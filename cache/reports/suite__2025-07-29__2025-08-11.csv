- z center-internal emitujemy event command.cm-coordinator.remove-site-channel
- przycisk aktywny jest tylko jeśli dany siteChannel nie ma żadnych ratePlanów
- cm-coordinator przed wykonaniem akcji weryfkuje czy w cm-mapping nie mamy żadnych mappingów w statusie draft bądź live (2x query do cm-mapping) oraz czy nie mamy żadnych nie usuniętych ratePlanów

Ostatnie przykłady:
Ustalenia po refinemencie:
- z center-internal emitujemy event command.cm-coordinator.remove-site-channel
- przycisk aktywny jest tylko jeśli dany siteChannel nie ma żadnych ratePlanów
- cm-coordinator przed wykonaniem akcji weryfkuje czy w cm-mapping nie mamy żadnych mappingów w statusie draft bądź live (2x query do cm-mapping) oraz czy nie mamy żadnych nie usuniętych ratePlanów
- logika w cm-coordinator opiera się o zwykły delete na cm_SiteChannels

Przegląd architekturySystem płatności w Upper6 składa się z następujących komponentów:1.1 KontroleryBooking_Step3_Controller (app/controllers/booking_step3.php) - główny kontroler obsługujący krok 3 rezerwacjiBooking_Payment_Controller (app/controllers/booking_payment.php) - kontroler obsługujący płatności dla istniejących rezerwacji1.2 Biblioteki zewnętrznelib-ideabooking - podstawowe klasy rezerwacji i metod płatnościBookingPaymentMethod - encja reprezentująca metodę płatnościBooking - główna klasa rezerwacjibe-gateways (vendor/profitroom/be-gateways) - integracje z bramkami płatnościPayment - klasa bazowa dla wszystkich płatnościKlasy specyficzne dla różnych metod płatności2. Flow zakładania płatności2.1 Krok 3 - Potwierdzenie rezerwacji z płatnościąUżytkownik wypełnia formularz na stronie step3Formularz jest wysyłany do action_confirm() metodą POSTWalidacja danych (linie 485-555 w booking_step3.php)Sprawdzenie dostępności (linie 478-483)Zapisanie danych rezerwacji (linie 556-745)2.2 Proces płatnościPobranie metody płatności:$Method = BookingPaymentMethod::Get($MethodID, $context->booking->OfferID, $context->booking->ChannelID);Utworzenie obiektu Payment:$Payment = Payment::ForMethod($Method);Ustawienie URL-i powrotu:$Payment->BackUrlOK = URL::to_action('booking@step3', array($layout, $site, $ref, $hash)).'?state=ok';
$Payment->BackUrlFail = URL::to_action('booking@step3', array($layout, $site, $ref, $hash)).'?state=failed';Procesowanie płatności:$Payment->Process($context->booking);2.3 Metoda Process() w klasie PaymentStandardowy flow:public function Process($Booking, $IsAvailCheck = true)

    $this->BeginPayment($Booking, $Transaction);
    $PaymentID = $this->CreatePayment($Booking, $Transaction);
    return $this->ConfirmBooking($Booking, $PaymentID, $IsAvailCheck);
}3. Typy odpowiedzi z klas Payment3.1 Klasy zwracające JSON z exitP24ApplePayPayment - zwraca JSON i kończy wykonanie:header('Content-Type: application/json');
echo json_encode($response);
exit;3.2 Klasy generujące HTML z formularzem POSTBePaymentProvidersPayment, ECardPayment, StripePayment - generują HTML z automatycznie wysyłanym formularzem3.3 Klasy bez bezpośredniego outputCreditCardPayment - nie generuje output, tylko zapisuje dane karty4. Wyzwania dla APIBrak jednolitego interfejsu - każda klasa może zwracać dane w inny sposóbUżycie exit - przerywa flow i uniemożliwia zwrócenie odpowiedzi JSONAutomatyczne przekierowania - formularze POST automatycznie przekierowują użytkownikaBrak możliwości przechwycenia exit - w PHP nie można przechwycić instrukcji exit/die5. Rekomendowane rozwiązanie dla APIOpcja 2: Nowe klasy Payment dla API (REKOMENDOWANA)Utworzenie dedykowanych klas dziedziczących po Payment, ale zwracających dane w formacie API:class ApiP24ApplePayPayment extends P24ApplePayPayment

PodsumowanieSystem płatności w Upper6 jest rozbudowany ale wymaga adaptacji dla API:Różne metody płatności używają różnych typów output (JSON, HTML, redirect)Istniejące klasy używają exit co komplikuje integrację z APIKonieczne jest utworzenie warstwy abstrakcji dla APIRekomendowane jest tworzenie dedykowanych klas API dziedziczących po istniejącychKluczowe jest zrozumienie flow: Step3 → Confirm → Payment::Process() → (JSON/HTML/Redirect)Warto sprawdzić też załączony plik"

Przegląd architekturySystem płatności w Upper6 składa się z następujących komponentów:1.1 KontroleryBooking_Step3_Controller (app/controllers/booking_step3.php) - główny kontroler obsługujący krok 3 rezerwacjiBooking_Payment_Controller (app/controllers/booking_payment.php) - kontroler obsługujący płatności dla istniejących rezerwacji1.2 Biblioteki zewnętrznelib-ideabooking - podstawowe klasy rezerwacji i metod płatnościBookingPaymentMethod - encja reprezentująca metodę płatnościBooking - główna klasa rezerwacjibe-gateways (vendor/profitroom/be-gateways) - integracje z bramkami płatnościPayment - klasa bazowa dla wszystkich płatnościKlasy specyficzne dla różnych metod płatności2. Flow zakładania płatności2.1 Krok 3 - Potwierdzenie rezerwacji z płatnościąUżytkownik wypełnia formularz na stronie step3Formularz jest wysyłany do action_confirm() metodą POSTWalidacja danych (linie 485-555 w booking_step3.php)Sprawdzenie dostępności (linie 478-483)Zapisanie danych rezerwacji (linie 556-745)2.2 Proces płatnościPobranie metody płatności:$Method = BookingPaymentMethod::Get($MethodID, $context->booking->OfferID, $context->booking->ChannelID);Utworzenie obiektu Payment:$Payment = Payment::ForMethod($Method);Ustawienie URL-i powrotu:$Payment->BackUrlOK = URL::to_action('booking@step3', array($layout, $site, $ref, $hash)).'?state=ok';
$Payment->BackUrlFail = URL::to_action('booking@step3', array($layout, $site, $ref, $hash)).'?state=failed';Procesowanie płatności:$Payment->Process($context->booking);2.3 Metoda Process() w klasie PaymentStandardowy flow:public function Process($Booking, $IsAvailCheck = true)
{
    BookingEvents::Fire('PaymentOpening', $Booking);
    $this->Validate($Booking);
    $Transaction = $this->CreateTransaction($Booking);
    $this->BeginPayment($Booking, $Transaction);
    $PaymentID = $this->CreatePayment($Booking, $Transaction);
    return $this->ConfirmBooking($Booking, $PaymentID, $IsAvailCheck);
}3. Typy odpowiedzi z klas Payment3.1 Klasy zwracające JSON z exitP24ApplePayPayment - zwraca JSON i kończy wykonanie:header('Content-Type: application/json');
echo json_encode($response);
exit;3.2 Klasy generujące HTML z formularzem POSTBePaymentProvidersPayment, ECardPayment, StripePayment - generują HTML z automatycznie wysyłanym formularzem3.3 Klasy bez bezpośredniego outputCreditCardPayment - nie generuje output, tylko zapisuje dane karty4. Wyzwania dla APIBrak jednolitego interfejsu - każda klasa może zwracać dane w inny sposóbUżycie exit - przerywa flow i uniemożliwia zwrócenie odpowiedzi JSONAutomatyczne przekierowania - formularze POST automatycznie przekierowują użytkownikaBrak możliwości przechwycenia exit - w PHP nie można przechwycić instrukcji exit/die5. Rekomendowane rozwiązanie dla APIOpcja 2: Nowe klasy Payment dla API (REKOMENDOWANA)Utworzenie dedykowanych klas dziedziczących po Payment, ale zwracających dane w formacie API:class ApiP24ApplePayPayment extends P24ApplePayPayment
{
    public function Process($Booking, $IsAvailCheck = true)
    {
        $this->Validate($Booking);

        ];
    }
}To podejście:Nie narusza istniejącej logikiPozwala na pełną kontrolę nad odpowiedziąJest zgodne z zasadą Open/ClosedUmożliwia stopniową migracjęUnika problemu z exit6. Przykładowy szkielet endpoint'a APIclass Step3_Api_Controller extends CheckoutV2_Base_Controller

BezpieczeństwoHash rezerwacji sprawdzany przy każdej operacjiCSRF protection (Laravel)Walidacja wszystkich danych wejściowychSSL/TLS wymagane dla płatności onlinePCI compliance dla płatności kartą8. PodsumowanieSystem płatności w Upper6 jest rozbudowany ale wymaga adaptacji dla API:Różne metody płatności używają różnych typów output (JSON, HTML, redirect)Istniejące klasy używają exit co komplikuje integrację z APIKonieczne jest utworzenie warstwy abstrakcji dla APIRekomendowane jest tworzenie dedykowanych klas API dziedziczących po istniejącychKluczowe jest zrozumienie flow: Step3 → Confirm → Payment::Process() → (JSON/HTML/Redirect)Warto sprawdzić też załączony plik"

Ustalenia po refinemencie:
- z center-internal emitujemy event command.cm-coordinator.remove-site-channel
- przycisk aktywny jest tylko jeśli dany siteChannel nie ma żadnych ratePlanów
- cm-coordinator przed wykonaniem akcji weryfkuje czy w cm-mapping nie mamy żadnych mappingów w statusie draft bądź live (2x query do cm-mapping) oraz czy nie mamy żadnych nie usuniętych ratePlanów
- logika w cm-coordinator opiera się o zwykły delete na cm_SiteChannels
todo: potwierdzić te ustalenia z

Przegląd architekturySystem płatności w Upper6 składa się z następujących komponentów:1.1 KontroleryBooking_Step3_Controller (app/controllers/booking_step3.php) - główny kontroler obsługujący krok 3 rezerwacjiBooking_Payment_Controller (app/controllers/booking_payment.php) - kontroler obsługujący płatności dla istniejących rezerwacji1.2 Biblioteki zewnętrznelib-ideabooking - podstawowe klasy rezerwacji i metod płatnościBookingPaymentMethod - encja reprezentująca metodę płatnościBooking - główna klasa rezerwacjibe-gateways (vendor/profitroom/be-gateways) - integracje z bramkami płatnościPayment - klasa bazowa dla wszystkich płatnościKlasy specyficzne dla różnych metod płatności2. Flow zakładania płatności2.1 Krok 3 - Potwierdzenie rezerwacji z płatnościąUżytkownik wypełnia formularz na stronie step3Formularz jest wysyłany do action_confirm() metodą POSTWalidacja danych (linie 485-555 w booking_step3.php)Sprawdzenie dostępności (linie 478-483)Zapisanie danych rezerwacji (linie 556-745)2.2 Proces płatnościPobranie metody płatności:$Method = BookingPaymentMethod::Get($MethodID, $context->booking->OfferID, $context->booking->ChannelID);Utworzenie obiektu Payment:$Payment = Payment::ForMethod($Method);Ustawienie URL-i powrotu:$Payment->BackUrlOK = URL::to_action('booking@step3', array($layout, $site, $ref, $hash)).'?state=ok';

}3. Typy odpowiedzi z klas Payment3.1 Klasy zwracające JSON z exitP24ApplePayPayment - zwraca JSON i kończy wykonanie:header('Content-Type: application/json');
echo json_encode($response);
exit;3.2 Klasy generujące HTML z formularzem POSTBePaymentProvidersPayment, ECardPayment, StripePayment - generują HTML z automatycznie wysyłanym formularzem3.3 Klasy bez bezpośredniego outputCreditCardPayment - nie generuje output, tylko zapisuje dane karty4. Wyzwania dla APIBrak jednolitego interfejsu - każda klasa może zwracać dane w inny sposóbUżycie exit - przerywa flow i uniemożliwia zwrócenie odpowiedzi JSONAutomatyczne przekierowania - formularze POST automatycznie przekierowują użytkownikaBrak możliwości przechwycenia exit - w PHP nie można przechwycić instrukcji exit/die5. Rekomendowane rozwiązanie dla APIOpcja 2: Nowe klasy Payment dla API (REKOMENDOWANA)Utworzenie dedykowanych klas dziedziczących po Payment, ale zwracających dane w formacie API:class ApiP24ApplePayPayment extends P24ApplePayPayment

Ostatnie przykłady:
Ustalenia po refinemencie:
- z center-internal emitujemy event command.cm-coordinator.remove-site-channel
- przycisk aktywny jest tylko jeśli dany siteChannel nie ma żadnych ratePlanów
- cm-coordinator przed wykonaniem akcji weryfkuje czy w cm-mapping nie mamy żadnych mappingów w statusie draft bądź live (2x query do cm-mapping) oraz czy nie mamy żadnych nie usuniętych ratePlanów
- logika w cm-coordinator opiera się o zwykły delete na cm_SiteChannels
todo: potwierdzić te ustalenia z
ADR: nie używamy logiki z abort onboarding, ponieważ bazuje ona na self-mappingu, a my chcemy umożliwić usuwanie tylko tych siteChannelów które NIE posiadają self-mappingu."

Lista obiektów znajduje się pod endpointem /related-sites (ustal który provider w kodzie odpowiada za pobranie oraz miejsce skąd najlepiej pobrać te dane np. store), każdy element w ramach response ma [address][coordinates][latitude] oraz [address][coordinates][longitude]. Po kliknięciu w obiekt na mapie zawsze wyświetli się popover ale zawartość popovera powinna być definiowana przez <slot> (slot powinien przekazywać parametr “item” co pozwoli na tworzenie zawartości dopasowanych do konkretnego przypadku w którym komponent mapy jest wykorzystywany) Zadania:komponent z mapą która znajduje się już w aplikacji pod {slug}/pricelist/rooms należy wydzielić jako osobny reużywalny komponent który będzie można wykorzystać w dwóch miejscach: {slug}/pricelist/rooms (występuje obecnie) oraz {slug}/locations (dodatkowe, nowe miejsce występowania).

Parametr: EndChargeDayOkreśla, do której doby pobytu naliczany jest podatek lub opłata.Przykłady użycia dla EndChargeDay = 3:Pobyt 1 doba → podatek naliczanyPobyt 2 doby → podatek naliczany za obie dobyPobyt 3 doby → podatek naliczany za wszystkie 3 dobyPobyt 4 doby lub więcej → podatek naliczany tylko za pierwsze 3 doby; brak podatku od 4 doby wzwyż Jednoczesne użycie: StartChargeDay + EndChargeDayPozwala określić konkretny przedział, w którym podatek/opłata ma być naliczana.Przykład: StartChargeDay = 2, EndChargeDay = 7:Podatek naliczany tylko za dni: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7Brak podatku za 1 dobę oraz doby 8+ (jeśli występują)Propozycja zmiany nazewnictwaObecne nazwy MinLOS i MaxLOS są potencjalnie mylące, ponieważ sugerują ograniczenie liczby opodatkowanych nocy, podczas gdy w rzeczywistości służą do filtrowania całych rezerwacji na etapie kwalifikacji.Rekomendacja:Rozważyć zmianę nazw na bardziej jednoznaczne, np. MinStayRequirement i MaxStayRequirement.Przyszłościowo/ alternatywnie włączyć MinLOS i MaxLOS jako warunki walidacyjne, które decydują, czy system w ogóle powinien przejść do naliczania podatku. Przykład: jeżeli rezerwacja spełnia MinLOS = 3, to dopiero wtedy stosowane są reguły StartChargeDay i EndChargeDay. FYIPowyższe parametry to ApplicableNights/ @max oraz ApplicableNights/ @excluded (dokumentacja WIHP str. 38)Zmienne:
- startChargeDay
- endChargeDay
Ustawiamy w bk_Taxes kolumna RestrictionsTEST CASY:
● Weryfikacja działania podatku bez ograniczeń czasowych    Kroki testowe:
  Skonfiguruj podatek typu ""Per Night"" z kwotą 10.00 bez parametrów ograniczeń => podatek zapisany poprawnie
  Utwórz rezerwację na 3 doby => podatek naliczony za wszystkie 3 doby (30.00 zł)  Weryfikacja parametru StartChargeDay    Kroki testowe:
  Skonfiguruj podatek z StartChargeDay=2, typu ""Per Night"", kwota 10.00 => podatek zapisany z ograniczeniem
  Utwórz rezerwację na 3 doby => podatek naliczony od dnia 2 (20.00 zł za 2 doby)
  Utwórz rezerwację na 2 doby ze StartChargeDay=5 => podatek wynosi 0.00 zł (StartChargeDay przekracza długość pobytu)  Weryfikacja parametru EndChargeDay    Kroki testowe:
  Skonfiguruj podatek z EndChargeDay=2, typu ""Per Night"", kwota 10.00 => podatek zapisany z ograniczeniem
  Utwórz rezerwację na 3 doby => podatek naliczony do dnia 2 (20.00 zł za 2 doby)
  Utwórz rezerwację na 3 doby z EndChargeDay=5 => podatek naliczony za wszystkie 3 doby (30.00 zł, EndChargeDay przekracza długość pobytu)  Weryfikacja kombinacji StartChargeDay i EndChargeDay    Kroki testowe:
  Skonfiguruj podatek z StartChargeDay=2 i EndChargeDay=3, typu ""Per Night"", kwota 10.00 => podatek zapisany z oboma ograniczeniami
  Utwórz rezerwację na 5 dób => podatek naliczony tylko za dni 2-3 (20.00 zł za 2 doby)
  Utwórz rezerwację na 5 dób z StartChargeDay=4 i EndChargeDay=2 => podatek wynosi 0.00 zł (nieprawidłowy zakres)  Weryfikacja ograniczeń dla podatku Per Person Per Night    Kroki testowe:
  Skonfiguruj podatek z StartChargeDay=2, EndChargeDay=4, typu ""Per Person Per Night"", kwota 8.00 => podatek zapisany
  Utwórz rezerwację na 6 dób dla 2 osób => podatek naliczony 48.00 zł (8.00 × 2 osoby × 3 doby)  Weryfikacja walidacji parametrów ograniczeń    Kroki testowe:
  Zapisz podatek z pustym polem Restrictions => podatek zapisany, działa bez ograniczeń
  Zapisz podatek z konfiguracją {""startChargeDay"": null, ""endChargeDay"": 3} => podatek zapisany, tylko endChargeDay aktywneModyfikacja rezerwacji z poziomu gościa, z zachowaniem wprowadzonych parametrów   Po modyfikacji rezerwacji parametry powinny zostać w niej zachowane i wartość podatków powinna wyliczyć się prawidłowo."

I don’t think that in this case any PMS system is using it to capture reservations from BE because “Upper“ it’s not available.
or whether as a separate channel maybe but it’s more “spaghetti solution“
In BE DB it has channel 1772 (CRM) instead of 100 (BE), but for ChM it is all just channel 2 but it’s just BE and most of the integrations is via CRS Connetor.
All properties from the master account Górskie Resorty - konto zbiorcze ID: 10880 (xxx) have CrsConnector.
Info directly from Waldek:
”The purpose of this task is to activate one of our key clients (Górskie Resorty Crystal Hotel) in terms of using the Sales Opportunities module (CRM).The main reason they are not currently using this module is the commission-based model in their sales team, where commission is calculated based on total sales as reported by the PMS. Unfortunately, at this point we do not send any information to the PMS indicating whether a reservation originated from the CRM (sales opportunity) or directly from the Booking Engine.To resolve this issue, we need to add a field to the reservation data indicating whether the booking came via a sales opportunity or through the standard Booking Engine flow.Our internal reports already support this information, so the objective of this task is to expose such a field (source of booking – CRM) in the Profitroom API, which is integrated with Betasi.The change should be guarded by a configuration variable so that it does not unintentionally affect existing client reporting.Once the change is delivered, the Customer Success team will reach out to the client to encourage Betasi to implement support for this variable in their reporting.”"

This migration requires contacting each client due to the need for different configuration values. The goal is to ensure a seamless transition by implementing a temporary variable to handle both authentication methods during the migration period.ContextCallPay is transitioning its authentication method from Basic Auth to a token-based system. The sunset date for Basic Auth is October 1st, 2025, after which only token-based authentication will be supported. The migration involves changing API endpoints from /v1 to /v2 and requires new configuration values (OrgId and Salt). The integration must support both authentication methods until all clients are migrated.Acceptance criteriaImplement a temporary variable Version=2 to switch to token-based authentication.Ensure the integration supports both Basic Auth and token-based authentication until migration is complete.Update API endpoints to /v2 for all relevant requests.Remove Basic Auth and add necessary headers (Auth-Token, Org-Id, Timestamp) when Version=2 is set.Generate Auth-Token using OrgId, Salt, and a Unix timestamp.Complete migration of all clients before October 1st, 2025.Remove the temporary variable and discontinue Basic Auth after migration.Other informationAnalysis and further details can be found here: CallPay Migration to v2.Postman resources and official documentation are available for reference.The Jira Epic related to this task is CONN-395.Example code for generating the Auth-Token is provided in the documentation.Support task to obtain Salt and OrdId from all Callpay clients: #570237"

This migration requires contacting each client due to the need for different configuration values. The goal is to ensure a seamless transition by implementing a temporary variable to handle both authentication methods during the migration period.ContextCallPay is transitioning its authentication method from Basic Auth to a token-based system. The sunset date for Basic Auth is October 1st, 2025, after which only token-based authentication will be supported. The migration involves changing API endpoints from /v1 to /v2 and requires new configuration values (OrgId and Salt). The integration must support both authentication methods until all clients are migrated.Acceptance criteriaImplement a temporary variable Version=2 to switch to token-based authentication.Ensure the integration supports both Basic Auth and token-based authentication until migration is complete.Update API endpoints to /v2 for all relevant requests.Remove Basic Auth and add necessary headers (Auth-Token, Org-Id, Timestamp) when Version=2 is set.Generate Auth-Token using OrgId, Salt, and a Unix timestamp.Complete migration of all clients before October 1st, 2025.Remove the temporary variable and discontinue Basic Auth after migration.Other informationAnalysis and further details can be found here: CallPay Migration to v2.Postman resources and official documentation are available for reference.The Jira Epic related to this task is CONN-395.Example code for generating the Auth-Token is provided in the documentation.Support task to obtain Salt and OrdId from all Callpay clients: #570237"

This migration requires contacting each client due to the need for different configuration values. The goal is to ensure a seamless transition by implementing a temporary variable to handle both authentication methods during the migration period.ContextCallPay is transitioning its authentication method from Basic Auth to a token-based system. The sunset date for Basic Auth is October 1st, 2025, after which only token-based authentication will be supported. The migration involves changing API endpoints from /v1 to /v2 and requires new configuration values (OrgId and Salt). The integration must support both authentication methods until all clients are migrated.Acceptance criteriaImplement a temporary variable Version=2 to switch to token-based authentication.Ensure the integration supports both Basic Auth and token-based authentication until migration is complete.Update API endpoints to /v2 for all relevant requests.Remove Basic Auth and add necessary headers (Auth-Token, Org-Id, Timestamp) when Version=2 is set.Generate Auth-Token using OrgId, Salt, and a Unix timestamp.Complete migration of all clients before October 1st, 2025.Remove the temporary variable and discontinue Basic Auth after migration.Other informationAnalysis and further details can be found here: CallPay Migration to v2.Postman resources and official documentation are available for reference.The Jira Epic related to this task is CONN-395.Example code for generating the Auth-Token is provided in the documentation.Support task to obtain Salt and OrdId from all Callpay clients: #570237"

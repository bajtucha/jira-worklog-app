This migration requires contacting each client due to the need for different configuration values. The goal is to ensure a seamless transition by implementing a temporary variable to handle both authentication methods during the migration period.ContextCallPay is transitioning its authentication method from Basic Auth to a token-based system. The sunset date for Basic Auth is October 1st, 2025, after which only token-based authentication will be supported. The migration involves changing API endpoints from /v1 to /v2 and requires new configuration values (OrgId and Salt). The integration must support both authentication methods until all clients are migrated.Acceptance criteriaImplement a temporary variable Version=2 to switch to token-based authentication.Ensure the integration supports both Basic Auth and token-based authentication until migration is complete.Update API endpoints to /v2 for all relevant requests.Remove Basic Auth and add necessary headers (Auth-Token, Org-Id, Timestamp) when Version=2 is set.Generate Auth-Token using OrgId, Salt, and a Unix timestamp.Complete migration of all clients before October 1st, 2025.Remove the temporary variable and discontinue Basic Auth after migration.Other informationAnalysis and further details can be found here: CallPay Migration to v2.Postman resources and official documentation are available for reference.The Jira Epic related to this task is CONN-395.Example code for generating the Auth-Token is provided in the documentation.Support task to obtain Salt and OrdId from all Callpay clients: #570237"

Moduły TimeSlot i UpsellNie wykryto naruszeń w tych modułach w przedstawionym raporcie.Szczegółowa Analiza ProblemówProblem 1: Warstwa Shared Zależy od Innych WarstwNajwiększym problemem jest to, że warstwa Shared, która powinna być niezależna, ma liczne zależności od innych warstw:Repozytoria w Shared zależą od modeli domenowych z innych warstw:OffersRepository, BookingConditionsRepository, PricingRepository itd.Interfejsy w Shared definiują metody używające typów z innych warstw:ExtrasFinderInterface, ReservationCancellerInterface, OffersRepositoryInterface itd.Handlery zdarzeń w Shared zależą od komend i klas z innych warstw:ReservationChangedByGuestSavedHandler, ReservationBaseHandler itd.Problem 2: GuestPanel Zależy od UpsellModuł GuestPanel nieprawidłowo zależy od modułu Upsell, co narusza zasadę separacji modułów:Klasy widoków i fabryk w GuestPanel używają klas z modułu UpsellRekomendacjeRefaktoryzacja warstwy Shared:Przenieś wspólne interfejsy i abstrakcje do SharedUsuń konkretne implementacje zależne od innych warstwWprowadź wzorce adaptacyjne lub fasady do komunikacji między warstwamiWprowadzenie warstwy abstrakcji:Stwórz interfejsy w Shared, które będą implementowane przez konkretne warstwyUżyj wstrzykiwania zależności do dostarczania implementacjiReorganizacja modeli domenowych:Przenieś wspólne modele do Shared lub stwórz ich abstrakcjeUżyj mapperów do konwersji między modelami różnych warstwUsunięcie bezpośrednich zależności GuestPanel od Upsell:Wprowadź interfejsy w Shared do komunikacji między tymi modułamiUżyj wzorca obserwatora lub mediatora do komunikacjiPodsumowanieRaport Deptrac ujawnił 84 naruszenia reguł architektury, głównie w warstwie Shared (78 naruszeń) i GuestPanel (6 naruszeń). Głównym problemem jest to, że warstwa Shared, która powinna być niezależna, ma liczne zależności od innych warstw, co narusza zasadę separacji modułów i może prowadzić do trudności w utrzymaniu i rozwijaniu aplikacji.

Moduły TimeSlot i UpsellNie wykryto naruszeń w tych modułach w przedstawionym raporcie.Szczegółowa Analiza ProblemówProblem 1: Warstwa Shared Zależy od Innych WarstwNajwiększym problemem jest to, że warstwa Shared, która powinna być niezależna, ma liczne zależności od innych warstw:Repozytoria w Shared zależą od modeli domenowych z innych warstw:OffersRepository, BookingConditionsRepository, PricingRepository itd.Interfejsy w Shared definiują metody używające typów z innych warstw:ExtrasFinderInterface, ReservationCancellerInterface, OffersRepositoryInterface itd.Handlery zdarzeń w Shared zależą od komend i klas z innych warstw:ReservationChangedByGuestSavedHandler, ReservationBaseHandler itd.Problem 2: GuestPanel Zależy od UpsellModuł GuestPanel nieprawidłowo zależy od modułu Upsell, co narusza zasadę separacji modułów:Klasy widoków i fabryk w GuestPanel używają klas z modułu UpsellRekomendacjeRefaktoryzacja warstwy Shared:Przenieś wspólne interfejsy i abstrakcje do SharedUsuń konkretne implementacje zależne od innych warstwWprowadź wzorce adaptacyjne lub fasady do komunikacji między warstwamiWprowadzenie warstwy abstrakcji:Stwórz interfejsy w Shared, które będą implementowane przez konkretne warstwyUżyj wstrzykiwania zależności do dostarczania implementacjiReorganizacja modeli domenowych:Przenieś wspólne modele do Shared lub stwórz ich abstrakcjeUżyj mapperów do konwersji między modelami różnych warstwUsunięcie bezpośrednich zależności GuestPanel od Upsell:Wprowadź interfejsy w Shared do komunikacji między tymi modułamiUżyj wzorca obserwatora lub mediatora do komunikacjiPodsumowanieRaport Deptrac ujawnił 84 naruszenia reguł architektury, głównie w warstwie Shared (78 naruszeń) i GuestPanel (6 naruszeń). Głównym problemem jest to, że warstwa Shared, która powinna być niezależna, ma liczne zależności od innych warstw, co narusza zasadę separacji modułów i może prowadzić do trudności w utrzymaniu i rozwijaniu aplikacji.

Od czasu do czasu zdarzają się requesty od FLS o usunięcie kanału OTA, np: dlatego, że ma być on podpięty przez self-mapping.
Ostatnie przykłady:
Ustalenia po refinemencie:
- z center-internal emitujemy event command.cm-coordinator.remove-site-channel
- przycisk aktywny jest tylko jeśli dany siteChannel nie ma żadnych ratePlanów
- cm-coordinator przed wykonaniem akcji weryfkuje czy w cm-mapping nie mamy żadnych mappingów w statusie draft bądź live (2x query do cm-mapping) oraz czy nie mamy żadnych nie usuniętych ratePlanów
- logika w cm-coordinator opiera się o zwykły delete na cm_SiteChannels
todo: potwierdzić te ustalenia z
ADR: nie używamy logiki z abort onboarding, ponieważ bazuje ona na self-mappingu, a my chcemy umożliwić usuwanie tylko tych siteChannelów które NIE posiadają self-mappingu."

This migration requires contacting each client due to the need for different configuration values.

The sunset date for Basic Auth is October 1st, 2025, after which only token-based authentication will be supported. The migration involves changing API endpoints from /v1 to /v2 and requires new configuration values (OrgId and Salt). The integration must support both authentication methods until all clients are migrated.Acceptance criteriaImplement a temporary variable Version=2 to switch to token-based authentication.Ensure the integration supports both Basic Auth and token-based authentication until migration is complete.Update API endpoints to /v2 for all relevant requests.Remove Basic Auth and add necessary headers (Auth-Token, Org-Id, Timestamp) when Version=2 is set.Generate Auth-Token using OrgId, Salt, and a Unix timestamp.Complete migration of all clients before October 1st, 2025.Remove the temporary variable and discontinue Basic Auth after migration.Other informationAnalysis and further details can be found here: CallPay Migration to v2.Postman resources and official documentation are available for reference.The Jira Epic related to this task is CONN-395.Example code for generating the Auth-Token is provided in the documentation.Support task to obtain Salt and OrdId from all Callpay clients: #570237"

Moduły TimeSlot i UpsellNie wykryto naruszeń w tych modułach w przedstawionym raporcie.Szczegółowa Analiza ProblemówProblem 1: Warstwa Shared Zależy od Innych WarstwNajwiększym problemem jest to, że warstwa Shared, która powinna być niezależna, ma liczne zależności od innych warstw:Repozytoria w Shared zależą od modeli domenowych z innych warstw:OffersRepository, BookingConditionsRepository, PricingRepository itd.Interfejsy w Shared definiują metody używające typów z innych warstw:ExtrasFinderInterface, ReservationCancellerInterface, OffersRepositoryInterface itd.Handlery zdarzeń w Shared zależą od komend i klas z innych warstw:ReservationChangedByGuestSavedHandler, ReservationBaseHandler itd.Problem 2: GuestPanel Zależy od UpsellModuł GuestPanel nieprawidłowo zależy od modułu Upsell, co narusza zasadę separacji modułów:Klasy widoków i fabryk w GuestPanel używają klas z modułu UpsellRekomendacjeRefaktoryzacja warstwy Shared:Przenieś wspólne interfejsy i abstrakcje do SharedUsuń konkretne implementacje zależne od innych warstwWprowadź wzorce adaptacyjne lub fasady do komunikacji między warstwamiWprowadzenie warstwy abstrakcji:Stwórz interfejsy w Shared, które będą implementowane przez konkretne warstwyUżyj wstrzykiwania zależności do dostarczania implementacjiReorganizacja modeli domenowych:Przenieś wspólne modele do Shared lub stwórz ich abstrakcjeUżyj mapperów do konwersji między modelami różnych warstwUsunięcie bezpośrednich zależności GuestPanel od Upsell:Wprowadź interfejsy w Shared do komunikacji między tymi modułamiUżyj wzorca obserwatora lub mediatora do komunikacjiPodsumowanieRaport Deptrac ujawnił 84 naruszenia reguł architektury, głównie w warstwie Shared (78 naruszeń) i GuestPanel (6 naruszeń). Głównym problemem jest to, że warstwa Shared, która powinna być niezależna, ma liczne zależności od innych warstw, co narusza zasadę separacji modułów i może prowadzić do trudności w utrzymaniu i rozwijaniu aplikacji. Konieczna jest refaktoryzacja, szczególnie warstwy Shared, aby przywrócić prawidłową strukturę zależności."

The sunset date for Basic Auth is October 1st, 2025, after which only token-based authentication will be supported. The migration involves changing API endpoints from /v1 to /v2 and requires new configuration values (OrgId and Salt). The integration must support both authentication methods until all clients are migrated.Acceptance criteriaImplement a temporary variable Version=2 to switch to token-based authentication.Ensure the integration supports both Basic Auth and token-based authentication until migration is complete.Update API endpoints to /v2 for all relevant requests.Remove Basic Auth and add necessary headers (Auth-Token, Org-Id, Timestamp) when Version=2 is set.Generate Auth-Token using OrgId, Salt, and a Unix timestamp.Complete migration of all clients before October 1st, 2025.Remove the temporary variable and discontinue Basic Auth after migration.Other informationAnalysis and further details can be found here: CallPay Migration to v2.Postman resources and official documentation are available for reference.The Jira Epic related to this task is CONN-395.Example code for generating the Auth-Token is provided in the documentation.Support task to obtain Salt and OrdId from all Callpay clients: #570237"

The client has proposed the introduction of an additional supplement to be applied to gaming rates.

Consequently, the hurdle rate should be validated against the total of the accommodation value plus the yieldable supplement.To be discussed/clarified with the client: Should the yield adjustment be added to the daily price or the total value of the stay?"

prawdopodobnie dobrym miejscem na buffor będzie cm-propagation-dispatcher, należy się upewnić czy wszystko przez niego “przechodzi” i poprawić jeśli nie (patrz: suite, center, lib-crs, pms[?], retriever/retriever-propagation-balancer, profitroom-api[?])
Po otrzymaniu zlecenia propagacji propagationJob nie tworzy się natychmiastowo, tylko jego potrzeba analizowana jest przez buffor;
- jeśli zlecenie nie jest w trybie force - wpada od razu
- jeśli zlecenie jest w trybie force - wrzucamy te zlecenie na kolejkę (prawdopodobnie jakiś wpis w redisie)
- kolejka analizowana będzie przez osobny proces (cron, co 30s? 60s?), który sprawdzać będzie czy dalej istnieje jakiś job w trybie force, a jeśli już nie istnieje, to zagreguje obecne zlecenia do 1 joba o odpowiednim poziomie force.
- można pokusić się o jakieś “sprytne” mechanizmy agregowania jobów, jeśli są jakieś pomysły (WAŻNE: Propagacja obecnie NIE WSPIERA Force dla KILKU cenników - bieżacy mechanizm - https://gitlab-ee.profitroom.net/connectivity/cm/services/propagation-legacy/blob/8625549e0e80f1c815cf5880791d4f7594317eb4/Engine/Core/ChannelManagerAPI.php#L106-106 - wspiera jedynie propagację na jeden cennik. Tym samym, jeśli chcesz agregować kilka force-ów dla różnych cenników, to musisz zagregować je do propagacji CAŁEGO KANAŁU).łapiemy wpisy które normalnie wpadły by do propagationJobs i wrzucamy je do buffora, po dodaniu ich do bazy wrzucamy też na kolejkę beanstalkowąprzygotować follow-up w którym przeanalizujemy miejsca które obecnie zlecają propagacje i zastanowieniu się czy możemy to przerobić tak żeby propagował się tylko pojedyńczy rateplanreTestyNa razie testy dotyczą jedynie propagacji zlecanych poprzez komendę: command.cm-propagation-dispatcher.propagate-mapping. Czyli dzieją się w ramach modyfikacji self-mappingu.Alternatywnie, można testować zlecanie propagacji z dashboardu, poprzez ręczne wysłanie komendy.Ważne: Bufor “obsługiwany” jest co minutę, a joby w obrębie sajta jako tako są obsługiwane w kolejności wrzucenia (nie dotyczy channelId 1)Ważne 2: Celem bufora jest sprawienie że system będzie przetwarzał maksymalnie jedną propagację z Force dla danego sajta w danym momencie!Weryfikujemy czy:Propagacja bez parametru Force - czyli w przypadku tego ms-u, bez przekazanego w payloadzie channelId - powinna być zlecana natychmiastowoPropagacje z parametrem Force. powinna skutkować wrzuceniem jobu do bufora. Kilkukrotne zlecenie TEJ samej propagacji powinno skutkować tylko jednym jobem. Szczegółowe zachowania jobów w buforze przedstawia tabelka, natomiast istotne jest to że ChannelID = 1 ma priorytet, czyli obsługiwany jest poza kolejnością. Dodatkowo gdy w buforze jest ChannelID = 1 oraz inne kanały, to są one wyrzucane z bufora, bo propagacja ChannelID = 1 powinno spropagować wszystko.ChannelID w buforzeChannelID w tabeliCzy job w tabeli jest rozpoczętyAkcja33NieUsuń33TakCzekaj36NieCzekaj36TakCzekaj13NieCzekaj13TakCzekaj31NieUsuń31TakCzekaj"

Od czasu do czasu zdarzają się requesty od FLS o usunięcie kanału OTA, np: dlatego, że ma być on podpięty przez self-mapping.
Ostatnie przykłady:
Ustalenia po refinemencie:
- z center-internal emitujemy event command.cm-coordinator.remove-site-channel
- przycisk aktywny jest tylko jeśli dany siteChannel nie ma żadnych ratePlanów
- cm-coordinator przed wykonaniem akcji weryfkuje czy w cm-mapping nie mamy żadnych mappingów w statusie draft bądź live (2x query do cm-mapping) oraz czy nie mamy żadnych nie usuniętych ratePlanów
- logika w cm-coordinator opiera się o zwykły delete na cm_SiteChannels
todo: potwierdzić te ustalenia z
ADR: nie używamy logiki z abort onboarding, ponieważ bazuje ona na self-mappingu, a my chcemy umożliwić usuwanie tylko tych siteChannelów które NIE posiadają self-mappingu."

This integration will facilitate the management of reservations, rates, and availability updates between the two systems.ContextCloudbeds is a PMS that connects with MyAllocator, a channel manager. The integration will require both push and pull methods for reservations to ensure data consistency and reliability. This is crucial for handling booking statuses, multi-room bookings, and various pricing models. The integration will also involve setting up authentication using a shared secret, username, and password unique to each hotel.Acceptance criteriaImplement push and pull methods for reservations, including new bookings, modifications, and cancellations.Support multi-room bookings and handle daily and total amounts, including gross amounts.Implement ARI (Availability, Rates, and Inventory) updates, including room-based and occupancy-based pricing.Ensure all requests include a secret_key, username, password, and property ID.Implement the following reservation features:Booking status updates for new, modified, and canceled bookings.Support for guest counts, including adults and children.Handle profiles for bookers, guests, companies, and travel agents.Include credit card details and comments/requests in reservations.Manage extras, deposits, loyalty details, corporate connect profiles, and vouchers.Ensure metadata import for room types and rate plans, with error handling for rate plan conflicts.Conduct HealthCheck and SetupProperty calls to verify credentials and system communication.Other informationAnalysis document: Cloudbeds API AnalysisPostman collection: [PMS] CloudBeds - MyAllocatorOfficial documentation: Myallocator GitHubJira Epic: PCONN-62Extranet access URL: https://inbox.myallocator.com/en/loginBase URLs for live environments:ARI: https://pms.profitroom.net/cloudbeds/<action>Reservations (push): https://api.myallocator.com/callback/ota/pro/v202203/<action>"

prawdopodobnie dobrym miejscem na buffor będzie cm-propagation-dispatcher, należy się upewnić czy wszystko przez niego “przechodzi” i poprawić jeśli nie (patrz: suite, center, lib-crs, pms[?], retriever/retriever-propagation-balancer, profitroom-api[?])
Po otrzymaniu zlecenia propagacji propagationJob nie tworzy się natychmiastowo, tylko jego potrzeba analizowana jest przez buffor;
- jeśli zlecenie nie jest w trybie force - wpada od razu
- jeśli zlecenie jest w trybie force - wrzucamy te zlecenie na kolejkę (prawdopodobnie jakiś wpis w redisie)
- kolejka analizowana będzie przez osobny proces (cron, co 30s? 60s?), który sprawdzać będzie czy dalej istnieje jakiś job w trybie force, a jeśli już nie istnieje, to zagreguje obecne zlecenia do 1 joba o odpowiednim poziomie force.
- można pokusić się o jakieś “sprytne” mechanizmy agregowania jobów, jeśli są jakieś pomysły (WAŻNE: Propagacja obecnie NIE WSPIERA Force dla KILKU cenników - bieżacy mechanizm - https://gitlab-ee.profitroom.net/connectivity/cm/services/propagation-legacy/blob/8625549e0e80f1c815cf5880791d4f7594317eb4/Engine/Core/ChannelManagerAPI.php#L106-106 - wspiera jedynie propagację na jeden cennik. Tym samym, jeśli chcesz agregować kilka force-ów dla różnych cenników, to musisz zagregować je do propagacji CAŁEGO KANAŁU).łapiemy wpisy które normalnie wpadły by do propagationJobs i wrzucamy je do buffora, po dodaniu ich do bazy wrzucamy też na kolejkę beanstalkowąprzygotować follow-up w którym przeanalizujemy miejsca które obecnie zlecają propagacje i zastanowieniu się czy możemy to przerobić tak żeby propagował się tylko pojedyńczy rateplanreTestyNa razie testy dotyczą jedynie propagacji zlecanych poprzez komendę: command.cm-propagation-dispatcher.propagate-mapping. Czyli dzieją się w ramach modyfikacji self-mappingu.Alternatywnie, można testować zlecanie propagacji z dashboardu, poprzez ręczne wysłanie komendy.Ważne: Bufor “obsługiwany” jest co minutę, a joby w obrębie sajta jako tako są obsługiwane w kolejności wrzucenia (nie dotyczy channelId 1)Ważne 2: Celem bufora jest sprawienie że system będzie przetwarzał maksymalnie jedną propagację z Force dla danego sajta w danym momencie!Weryfikujemy czy:Propagacja bez parametru Force - czyli w przypadku tego ms-u, bez przekazanego w payloadzie channelId - powinna być zlecana natychmiastowoPropagacje z parametrem Force. powinna skutkować wrzuceniem jobu do bufora. Kilkukrotne zlecenie TEJ samej propagacji powinno skutkować tylko jednym jobem. Szczegółowe zachowania jobów w buforze przedstawia tabelka, natomiast istotne jest to że ChannelID = 1 ma priorytet, czyli obsługiwany jest poza kolejnością. Dodatkowo gdy w buforze jest ChannelID = 1 oraz inne kanały, to są one wyrzucane z bufora, bo propagacja ChannelID = 1 powinno spropagować wszystko.ChannelID w buforzeChannelID w tabeliCzy job w tabeli jest rozpoczętyAkcja33NieUsuń33TakCzekaj36NieCzekaj36TakCzekaj13NieCzekaj13TakCzekaj31NieUsuń31TakCzekaj"

Wyzwania dla APIBrak jednolitego interfejsu - każda klasa może zwracać dane w inny sposóbUżycie exit - przerywa flow i uniemożliwia zwrócenie odpowiedzi JSONAutomatyczne przekierowania - formularze POST automatycznie przekierowują użytkownikaBrak możliwości przechwycenia exit - w PHP nie można przechwycić instrukcji exit/die5. Rekomendowane rozwiązanie dla APIOpcja 2: Nowe klasy Payment dla API (REKOMENDOWANA)Utworzenie dedykowanych klas dziedziczących po Payment, ale zwracających dane w formacie API:class ApiP24ApplePayPayment extends P24ApplePayPayment

Przegląd architekturySystem płatności w Upper6 składa się z następujących komponentów:1.1 KontroleryBooking_Step3_Controller (app/controllers/booking_step3.php) - główny kontroler obsługujący krok 3 rezerwacjiBooking_Payment_Controller (app/controllers/booking_payment.php) - kontroler obsługujący płatności dla istniejących rezerwacji1.2 Biblioteki zewnętrznelib-ideabooking - podstawowe klasy rezerwacji i metod płatnościBookingPaymentMethod - encja reprezentująca metodę płatnościBooking - główna klasa rezerwacjibe-gateways (vendor/profitroom/be-gateways) - integracje z bramkami płatnościPayment - klasa bazowa dla wszystkich płatnościKlasy specyficzne dla różnych metod płatności2. Flow zakładania płatności2.1 Krok 3 - Potwierdzenie rezerwacji z płatnościąUżytkownik wypełnia formularz na stronie step3Formularz jest wysyłany do action_confirm() metodą POSTWalidacja danych (linie 485-555 w booking_step3.php)Sprawdzenie dostępności (linie 478-483)Zapisanie danych rezerwacji (linie 556-745)2.2 Proces płatnościPobranie metody płatności:$Method = BookingPaymentMethod::Get($MethodID, $context->booking->OfferID, $context->booking->ChannelID);Utworzenie obiektu Payment:$Payment = Payment::ForMethod($Method);Ustawienie URL-i powrotu:$Payment->BackUrlOK = URL::to_action('booking@step3', array($layout, $site, $ref, $hash)).'?state=ok';
$Payment->BackUrlFail = URL::to_action('booking@step3', array($layout, $site, $ref, $hash)).'?state=failed';Procesowanie płatności:$Payment->Process($context->booking);2.3 Metoda Process() w klasie PaymentStandardowy flow:public function Process($Booking, $IsAvailCheck = true)
{
    BookingEvents::Fire('PaymentOpening', $Booking);
    $this->Validate($Booking);
    $Transaction = $this->CreateTransaction($Booking);
    $this->BeginPayment($Booking, $Transaction);
    $PaymentID = $this->CreatePayment($Booking, $Transaction);
    return $this->ConfirmBooking($Booking, $PaymentID, $IsAvailCheck);
}3. Typy odpowiedzi z klas Payment3.1 Klasy zwracające JSON z exitP24ApplePayPayment - zwraca JSON i kończy wykonanie:header('Content-Type: application/json');
echo json_encode($response);
exit;3.2 Klasy generujące HTML z formularzem POSTBePaymentProvidersPayment, ECardPayment, StripePayment - generują HTML z automatycznie wysyłanym formularzem3.3 Klasy bez bezpośredniego outputCreditCardPayment - nie generuje output, tylko zapisuje dane karty4. Wyzwania dla APIBrak jednolitego interfejsu - każda klasa może zwracać dane w inny sposóbUżycie exit - przerywa flow i uniemożliwia zwrócenie odpowiedzi JSONAutomatyczne przekierowania - formularze POST automatycznie przekierowują użytkownikaBrak możliwości przechwycenia exit - w PHP nie można przechwycić instrukcji exit/die5. Rekomendowane rozwiązanie dla APIOpcja 2: Nowe klasy Payment dla API (REKOMENDOWANA)Utworzenie dedykowanych klas dziedziczących po Payment, ale zwracających dane w formacie API:class ApiP24ApplePayPayment extends P24ApplePayPayment
{
    public function Process($Booking, $IsAvailCheck = true)
    {
        $this->Validate($Booking);
        $transaction = $this->CreateTransaction($Booking);

        ];
    }
}To podejście:Nie narusza istniejącej logikiPozwala na pełną kontrolę nad odpowiedziąJest zgodne z zasadą Open/ClosedUmożliwia stopniową migracjęUnika problemu z exit6. Przykładowy szkielet endpoint'a APIclass Step3_Api_Controller extends CheckoutV2_Base_Controller

        // 1. Walidacja i pobranie rezerwacji
        $booking = $this->fetchBookingByReference($bookingRef);
        // 2. Sprawdzenie hash'a
        if ($hash != $booking->GetHash()) {

BezpieczeństwoHash rezerwacji sprawdzany przy każdej operacjiCSRF protection (Laravel)Walidacja wszystkich danych wejściowychSSL/TLS wymagane dla płatności onlinePCI compliance dla płatności kartą8. PodsumowanieSystem płatności w Upper6 jest rozbudowany ale wymaga adaptacji dla API:Różne metody płatności używają różnych typów output (JSON, HTML, redirect)Istniejące klasy używają exit co komplikuje integrację z APIKonieczne jest utworzenie warstwy abstrakcji dla APIRekomendowane jest tworzenie dedykowanych klas API dziedziczących po istniejącychKluczowe jest zrozumienie flow: Step3 → Confirm → Payment::Process() → (JSON/HTML/Redirect)Warto sprawdzić też załączony plik"

Przegląd architekturySystem płatności w Upper6 składa się z następujących komponentów:1.1 KontroleryBooking_Step3_Controller (app/controllers/booking_step3.php) - główny kontroler obsługujący krok 3 rezerwacjiBooking_Payment_Controller (app/controllers/booking_payment.php) - kontroler obsługujący płatności dla istniejących rezerwacji1.2 Biblioteki zewnętrznelib-ideabooking - podstawowe klasy rezerwacji i metod płatnościBookingPaymentMethod - encja reprezentująca metodę płatnościBooking - główna klasa rezerwacjibe-gateways (vendor/profitroom/be-gateways) - integracje z bramkami płatnościPayment - klasa bazowa dla wszystkich płatnościKlasy specyficzne dla różnych metod płatności2. Flow zakładania płatności2.1 Krok 3 - Potwierdzenie rezerwacji z płatnościąUżytkownik wypełnia formularz na stronie step3Formularz jest wysyłany do action_confirm() metodą POSTWalidacja danych (linie 485-555 w booking_step3.php)Sprawdzenie dostępności (linie 478-483)Zapisanie danych rezerwacji (linie 556-745)2.2 Proces płatnościPobranie metody płatności:$Method = BookingPaymentMethod::Get($MethodID, $context->booking->OfferID, $context->booking->ChannelID);Utworzenie obiektu Payment:$Payment = Payment::ForMethod($Method);Ustawienie URL-i powrotu:$Payment->BackUrlOK = URL::to_action('booking@step3', array($layout, $site, $ref, $hash)).'?state=ok';
$Payment->BackUrlFail = URL::to_action('booking@step3', array($layout, $site, $ref, $hash)).'?state=failed';Procesowanie płatności:$Payment->Process($context->booking);2.3 Metoda Process() w klasie PaymentStandardowy flow:public function Process($Booking, $IsAvailCheck = true)
{
    BookingEvents::Fire('PaymentOpening', $Booking);
    $this->Validate($Booking);
    $Transaction = $this->CreateTransaction($Booking);
    $this->BeginPayment($Booking, $Transaction);
    $PaymentID = $this->CreatePayment($Booking, $Transaction);
    return $this->ConfirmBooking($Booking, $PaymentID, $IsAvailCheck);
}3. Typy odpowiedzi z klas Payment3.1 Klasy zwracające JSON z exitP24ApplePayPayment - zwraca JSON i kończy wykonanie:header('Content-Type: application/json');
echo json_encode($response);
exit;3.2 Klasy generujące HTML z formularzem POSTBePaymentProvidersPayment, ECardPayment, StripePayment - generują HTML z automatycznie wysyłanym formularzem3.3 Klasy bez bezpośredniego outputCreditCardPayment - nie generuje output, tylko zapisuje dane karty4. Wyzwania dla APIBrak jednolitego interfejsu - każda klasa może zwracać dane w inny sposóbUżycie exit - przerywa flow i uniemożliwia zwrócenie odpowiedzi JSONAutomatyczne przekierowania - formularze POST automatycznie przekierowują użytkownikaBrak możliwości przechwycenia exit - w PHP nie można przechwycić instrukcji exit/die5. Rekomendowane rozwiązanie dla APIOpcja 2: Nowe klasy Payment dla API (REKOMENDOWANA)Utworzenie dedykowanych klas dziedziczących po Payment, ale zwracających dane w formacie API:class ApiP24ApplePayPayment extends P24ApplePayPayment
{
    public function Process($Booking, $IsAvailCheck = true)
    {
        $this->Validate($Booking);

PodsumowanieSystem płatności w Upper6 jest rozbudowany ale wymaga adaptacji dla API:Różne metody płatności używają różnych typów output (JSON, HTML, redirect)Istniejące klasy używają exit co komplikuje integrację z APIKonieczne jest utworzenie warstwy abstrakcji dla APIRekomendowane jest tworzenie dedykowanych klas API dziedziczących po istniejącychKluczowe jest zrozumienie flow: Step3 → Confirm → Payment::Process() → (JSON/HTML/Redirect)Warto sprawdzić też załączony plik"

prawdopodobnie dobrym miejscem na buffor będzie cm-propagation-dispatcher, należy się upewnić czy wszystko przez niego “przechodzi” i poprawić jeśli nie (patrz: suite, center, lib-crs, pms[?], retriever/retriever-propagation-balancer, profitroom-api[?])
Po otrzymaniu zlecenia propagacji propagationJob nie tworzy się natychmiastowo, tylko jego potrzeba analizowana jest przez buffor;
- jeśli zlecenie nie jest w trybie force - wpada od razu
- jeśli zlecenie jest w trybie force - wrzucamy te zlecenie na kolejkę (prawdopodobnie jakiś wpis w redisie)
- kolejka analizowana będzie przez osobny proces (cron, co 30s? 60s?), który sprawdzać będzie czy dalej istnieje jakiś job w trybie force, a jeśli już nie istnieje, to zagreguje obecne zlecenia do 1 joba o odpowiednim poziomie force.

Przegląd architekturySystem płatności w Upper6 składa się z następujących komponentów:1.1 KontroleryBooking_Step3_Controller (app/controllers/booking_step3.php) - główny kontroler obsługujący krok 3 rezerwacjiBooking_Payment_Controller (app/controllers/booking_payment.php) - kontroler obsługujący płatności dla istniejących rezerwacji1.2 Biblioteki zewnętrznelib-ideabooking - podstawowe klasy rezerwacji i metod płatnościBookingPaymentMethod - encja reprezentująca metodę płatnościBooking - główna klasa rezerwacjibe-gateways (vendor/profitroom/be-gateways) - integracje z bramkami płatnościPayment - klasa bazowa dla wszystkich płatnościKlasy specyficzne dla różnych metod płatności2. Flow zakładania płatności2.1 Krok 3 - Potwierdzenie rezerwacji z płatnościąUżytkownik wypełnia formularz na stronie step3Formularz jest wysyłany do action_confirm() metodą POSTWalidacja danych (linie 485-555 w booking_step3.php)Sprawdzenie dostępności (linie 478-483)Zapisanie danych rezerwacji (linie 556-745)2.2 Proces płatnościPobranie metody płatności:$Method = BookingPaymentMethod::Get($MethodID, $context->booking->OfferID, $context->booking->ChannelID);Utworzenie obiektu Payment:$Payment = Payment::ForMethod($Method);Ustawienie URL-i powrotu:$Payment->BackUrlOK = URL::to_action('booking@step3', array($layout, $site, $ref, $hash)).'?state=ok';
$Payment->BackUrlFail = URL::to_action('booking@step3', array($layout, $site, $ref, $hash)).'?state=failed';Procesowanie płatności:$Payment->Process($context->booking);2.3 Metoda Process() w klasie PaymentStandardowy flow:public function Process($Booking, $IsAvailCheck = true)

    $this->Validate($Booking);
    $Transaction = $this->CreateTransaction($Booking);
    $this->BeginPayment($Booking, $Transaction);
    $PaymentID = $this->CreatePayment($Booking, $Transaction);
    return $this->ConfirmBooking($Booking, $PaymentID, $IsAvailCheck);
}3. Typy odpowiedzi z klas Payment3.1 Klasy zwracające JSON z exitP24ApplePayPayment - zwraca JSON i kończy wykonanie:header('Content-Type: application/json');
echo json_encode($response);
exit;3.2 Klasy generujące HTML z formularzem POSTBePaymentProvidersPayment, ECardPayment, StripePayment - generują HTML z automatycznie wysyłanym formularzem3.3 Klasy bez bezpośredniego outputCreditCardPayment - nie generuje output, tylko zapisuje dane karty4. Wyzwania dla APIBrak jednolitego interfejsu - każda klasa może zwracać dane w inny sposóbUżycie exit - przerywa flow i uniemożliwia zwrócenie odpowiedzi JSONAutomatyczne przekierowania - formularze POST automatycznie przekierowują użytkownikaBrak możliwości przechwycenia exit - w PHP nie można przechwycić instrukcji exit/die5. Rekomendowane rozwiązanie dla APIOpcja 2: Nowe klasy Payment dla API (REKOMENDOWANA)Utworzenie dedykowanych klas dziedziczących po Payment, ale zwracających dane w formacie API:class ApiP24ApplePayPayment extends P24ApplePayPayment

PodsumowanieSystem płatności w Upper6 jest rozbudowany ale wymaga adaptacji dla API:Różne metody płatności używają różnych typów output (JSON, HTML, redirect)Istniejące klasy używają exit co komplikuje integrację z APIKonieczne jest utworzenie warstwy abstrakcji dla APIRekomendowane jest tworzenie dedykowanych klas API dziedziczących po istniejącychKluczowe jest zrozumienie flow: Step3 → Confirm → Payment::Process() → (JSON/HTML/Redirect)Warto sprawdzić też załączony plik"

Przegląd architekturySystem płatności w Upper6 składa się z następujących komponentów:1.1 KontroleryBooking_Step3_Controller (app/controllers/booking_step3.php) - główny kontroler obsługujący krok 3 rezerwacjiBooking_Payment_Controller (app/controllers/booking_payment.php) - kontroler obsługujący płatności dla istniejących rezerwacji1.2 Biblioteki zewnętrznelib-ideabooking - podstawowe klasy rezerwacji i metod płatnościBookingPaymentMethod - encja reprezentująca metodę płatnościBooking - główna klasa rezerwacjibe-gateways (vendor/profitroom/be-gateways) - integracje z bramkami płatnościPayment - klasa bazowa dla wszystkich płatnościKlasy specyficzne dla różnych metod płatności2. Flow zakładania płatności2.1 Krok 3 - Potwierdzenie rezerwacji z płatnościąUżytkownik wypełnia formularz na stronie step3Formularz jest wysyłany do action_confirm() metodą POSTWalidacja danych (linie 485-555 w booking_step3.php)Sprawdzenie dostępności (linie 478-483)Zapisanie danych rezerwacji (linie 556-745)2.2 Proces płatnościPobranie metody płatności:$Method = BookingPaymentMethod::Get($MethodID, $context->booking->OfferID, $context->booking->ChannelID);Utworzenie obiektu Payment:$Payment = Payment::ForMethod($Method);Ustawienie URL-i powrotu:$Payment->BackUrlOK = URL::to_action('booking@step3', array($layout, $site, $ref, $hash)).'?state=ok';
$Payment->BackUrlFail = URL::to_action('booking@step3', array($layout, $site, $ref, $hash)).'?state=failed';Procesowanie płatności:$Payment->Process($context->booking);2.3 Metoda Process() w klasie PaymentStandardowy flow:public function Process($Booking, $IsAvailCheck = true)

    BookingEvents::Fire('PaymentOpening', $Booking);
    $this->Validate($Booking);
    $Transaction = $this->CreateTransaction($Booking);
    $this->BeginPayment($Booking, $Transaction);
    $PaymentID = $this->CreatePayment($Booking, $Transaction);
    return $this->ConfirmBooking($Booking, $PaymentID, $IsAvailCheck);
}3. Typy odpowiedzi z klas Payment3.1 Klasy zwracające JSON z exitP24ApplePayPayment - zwraca JSON i kończy wykonanie:header('Content-Type: application/json');
echo json_encode($response);
exit;3.2 Klasy generujące HTML z formularzem POSTBePaymentProvidersPayment, ECardPayment, StripePayment - generują HTML z automatycznie wysyłanym formularzem3.3 Klasy bez bezpośredniego outputCreditCardPayment - nie generuje output, tylko zapisuje dane karty4. Wyzwania dla APIBrak jednolitego interfejsu - każda klasa może zwracać dane w inny sposóbUżycie exit - przerywa flow i uniemożliwia zwrócenie odpowiedzi JSONAutomatyczne przekierowania - formularze POST automatycznie przekierowują użytkownikaBrak możliwości przechwycenia exit - w PHP nie można przechwycić instrukcji exit/die5. Rekomendowane rozwiązanie dla APIOpcja 2: Nowe klasy Payment dla API (REKOMENDOWANA)Utworzenie dedykowanych klas dziedziczących po Payment, ale zwracających dane w formacie API:class ApiP24ApplePayPayment extends P24ApplePayPayment

PodsumowanieSystem płatności w Upper6 jest rozbudowany ale wymaga adaptacji dla API:Różne metody płatności używają różnych typów output (JSON, HTML, redirect)Istniejące klasy używają exit co komplikuje integrację z APIKonieczne jest utworzenie warstwy abstrakcji dla APIRekomendowane jest tworzenie dedykowanych klas API dziedziczących po istniejącychKluczowe jest zrozumienie flow: Step3 → Confirm → Payment::Process() → (JSON/HTML/Redirect)Warto sprawdzić też załączony plik"

This migration requires contacting each client due to the need for different configuration values. The goal is to ensure a seamless transition by implementing a temporary variable to handle both authentication methods during the migration period.ContextCallPay is transitioning its authentication method from Basic Auth to a token-based system. The sunset date for Basic Auth is October 1st, 2025, after which only token-based authentication will be supported. The migration involves changing API endpoints from /v1 to /v2 and requires new configuration values (OrgId and Salt). The integration must support both authentication methods until all clients are migrated.Acceptance criteriaImplement a temporary variable Version=2 to switch to token-based authentication.Ensure the integration supports both Basic Auth and token-based authentication until migration is complete.Update API endpoints to /v2 for all relevant requests.Remove Basic Auth and add necessary headers (Auth-Token, Org-Id, Timestamp) when Version=2 is set.Generate Auth-Token using OrgId, Salt, and a Unix timestamp.Complete migration of all clients before October 1st, 2025.Remove the temporary variable and discontinue Basic Auth after migration.Other informationAnalysis and further details can be found here: CallPay Migration to v2.Postman resources and official documentation are available for reference.The Jira Epic related to this task is CONN-395.Example code for generating the Auth-Token is provided in the documentation.Support task to obtain Salt and OrdId from all Callpay clients: #570237"

Od czasu do czasu zdarzają się requesty od FLS o usunięcie kanału OTA, np: dlatego, że ma być on podpięty przez self-mapping.
Ostatnie przykłady:
Ustalenia po refinemencie:
- z center-internal emitujemy event command.cm-coordinator.remove-site-channel
- przycisk aktywny jest tylko jeśli dany siteChannel nie ma żadnych ratePlanów
- cm-coordinator przed wykonaniem akcji weryfkuje czy w cm-mapping nie mamy żadnych mappingów w statusie draft bądź live (2x query do cm-mapping) oraz czy nie mamy żadnych nie usuniętych ratePlanów
- logika w cm-coordinator opiera się o zwykły delete na cm_SiteChannels
todo: potwierdzić te ustalenia z
ADR: nie używamy logiki z abort onboarding, ponieważ bazuje ona na self-mappingu, a my chcemy umożliwić usuwanie tylko tych siteChannelów które NIE posiadają self-mappingu."

Moduł Ofert (offers):Test przypadku użycia: Wyświetlanie listy ofertCel: Sprawdzenie, czy lista ofert jest poprawnie ładowana i wyświetlana.Kroki:Przejdź do sekcji, gdzie wyświetlane są oferty (np. lista ofert, panel administracyjny ofert).Sprawdź, czy wszystkie oferty są widoczne i poprawnie załadowane.Zweryfikuj, czy dane ofert (nazwa, cena, status itp.) są prawidłowe.Test przypadku użycia: Wyszukiwanie oferty po IDCel: Sprawdzenie, czy funkcja findOfferById działa poprawnie.Kroki:Zidentyfikuj istniejącą ofertę i jej ID.W aplikacji, spróbuj wyszukać lub wyświetlić szczegóły tej oferty, używając jej ID (jeśli istnieje taka funkcjonalność w UI).Zweryfikuj, czy odpowiednie dane oferty są wyświetlane.Spróbuj wyszukać ofertę, która nie istnieje i sprawdź, czy aplikacja poprawnie obsługuje ten scenariusz (np. wyświetla komunikat ""nie znaleziono"").2. Moduł Przeliczania Cen (priceRecalculation):Test przypadku użycia: Inicjowanie przeliczania ceny dla pojedynczej ofertyCel: Sprawdzenie, czy przeliczanie ceny dla pojedynczej oferty jest inicjowane i śledzone.Kroki:Przejdź do widoku oferty, która może być przeliczana (jeśli istnieje taka funkcjonalność UI, np. przycisk ""Przelicz cenę"").Zainicjuj przeliczanie ceny.Obserwuj interfejs użytkownika pod kątem komunikatów o ""recalculation requested"".Po pewnym czasie, sprawdź, czy status przeliczania ceny dla tej oferty został zaktualizowany (np. czy cena jest oznaczona jako przeliczona).Test przypadku użycia: Przeliczanie wielu ofertCel: Sprawdzenie, czy przeliczanie cen dla wielu ofert działa poprawnie.Kroki:Zainicjuj przeliczanie cen dla wielu ofert jednocześnie (jeśli istnieje taka funkcjonalność UI, np. ""przelicz wszystkie ceny"").Monitoruj postęp przeliczania.Zweryfikuj, czy wszystkie wybrane oferty zostały poprawnie przeliczone.Test przypadku użycia: Restartowanie i Zatrzymywanie procesu przeliczaniaCel: Sprawdzenie, czy funkcje restart i kill działają zgodnie z oczekiwaniami.Kroki:Zainicjuj przeliczanie cen.W trakcie procesu, spróbuj ""zrestartować"" (jeśli jest taka opcja). Sprawdź, czy proces jest kontynuowany.W trakcie procesu, spróbuj ""zatrzymać/zabić"" proces (jeśli jest taka opcja). Sprawdź, czy proces przeliczania zostaje zatrzymany i czy dane są resetowane.Test przypadku użycia: Obsługa błędów podczas przeliczaniaCel: Sprawdzenie, jak aplikacja reaguje na błędy podczas przeliczania (np. brak odpowiedzi z serwera).Kroki:(Wymaga interwencji technicznej lub mockowania API) Zasymuluj błąd podczas wywołania OfferProvider.recalculate lub OfferProvider.checkRecalculation.Sprawdź, czy aplikacja poprawnie obsługuje błąd i czy nie wchodzi w niekończącą się pętlę.Zweryfikuj, czy użytkownik jest informowany o błędzie w czytelny sposób.3. Integracja z Innymi Modułami:Test przypadku użycia: Filtry Rezerwacji (ReservationFilters.vue)Cel: Sprawdzenie, czy filtry rezerwacji nadal poprawnie ładują dane o kanałach i typach pokoi.Kroki:Przejdź do widoku filtrów rezerwacji.Sprawdź, czy filtry (np. lista kanałów, lista typów pokoi) są poprawnie wypełnione danymi.Zastosuj różne filtry i zweryfikuj, czy wyniki są poprawne.Test przypadku użycia: Wydruk Rezerwacji (ReservationPrintoutProvider.vue)Cel: Sprawdzenie, czy wydruk rezerwacji nadal poprawnie ładuje dane o kanałach.Kroki:Otwórz funkcjonalność wydruku rezerwacji (jeśli istnieje).Zweryfikuj, czy dane związane z kanałami są poprawnie wyświetlane na wydruku.Wygeneruj wydruk i sprawdź jego poprawność.Ogólne uwagi do testów:Konsola Deweloperska: Monitoruj konsolę deweloperską pod kątem błędów JavaScript.Zapytania Sieciowe: Używaj narzędzi deweloperskich przeglądarki do monitorowania zapytań sieciowych, aby upewnić się, że dane są pobierane prawidłowo z backendu po migracji.Stan Aplikacji: W narzędziach deweloperskich Vue/Pinia (jeśli są dostępne) sprawdź, czy stan aplikacji (w Pinia store) jest poprawnie aktualizowany.Testy regresyjne: Oprócz powyższych, należy przeprowadzić ogólne testy regresyjne na obszarach, które korzystają z Vuex, aby upewnić się, że migracja nie wprowadziła niezamierzonych skutków ubocznych.Te testy powinny pomóc w weryfikacji, czy wszystkie zmiany związane z migracją do Pinia zostały poprawnie zaimplementowane i nie wpłynęły negatywnie na funkcjonalność aplikacji."

Moduł Ofert (offers):Test przypadku użycia: Wyświetlanie listy ofertCel: Sprawdzenie, czy lista ofert jest poprawnie ładowana i wyświetlana.Kroki:Przejdź do sekcji, gdzie wyświetlane są oferty (np. lista ofert, panel administracyjny ofert).Sprawdź, czy wszystkie oferty są widoczne i poprawnie załadowane.Zweryfikuj, czy dane ofert (nazwa, cena, status itp.) są prawidłowe.Test przypadku użycia: Wyszukiwanie oferty po IDCel: Sprawdzenie, czy funkcja findOfferById działa poprawnie.Kroki:Zidentyfikuj istniejącą ofertę i jej ID.W aplikacji, spróbuj wyszukać lub wyświetlić szczegóły tej oferty, używając jej ID (jeśli istnieje taka funkcjonalność w UI).Zweryfikuj, czy odpowiednie dane oferty są wyświetlane.Spróbuj wyszukać ofertę, która nie istnieje i sprawdź, czy aplikacja poprawnie obsługuje ten scenariusz (np. wyświetla komunikat ""nie znaleziono"").2. Moduł Przeliczania Cen (priceRecalculation):Test przypadku użycia: Inicjowanie przeliczania ceny dla pojedynczej ofertyCel: Sprawdzenie, czy przeliczanie ceny dla pojedynczej oferty jest inicjowane i śledzone.Kroki:Przejdź do widoku oferty, która może być przeliczana (jeśli istnieje taka funkcjonalność UI, np. przycisk ""Przelicz cenę"").Zainicjuj przeliczanie ceny.Obserwuj interfejs użytkownika pod kątem komunikatów o ""recalculation requested"".Po pewnym czasie, sprawdź, czy status przeliczania ceny dla tej oferty został zaktualizowany (np. czy cena jest oznaczona jako przeliczona).Test przypadku użycia: Przeliczanie wielu ofertCel: Sprawdzenie, czy przeliczanie cen dla wielu ofert działa poprawnie.Kroki:Zainicjuj przeliczanie cen dla wielu ofert jednocześnie (jeśli istnieje taka funkcjonalność UI, np. ""przelicz wszystkie ceny"").Monitoruj postęp przeliczania.Zweryfikuj, czy wszystkie wybrane oferty zostały poprawnie przeliczone.Test przypadku użycia: Restartowanie i Zatrzymywanie procesu przeliczaniaCel: Sprawdzenie, czy funkcje restart i kill działają zgodnie z oczekiwaniami.Kroki:Zainicjuj przeliczanie cen.W trakcie procesu, spróbuj ""zrestartować"" (jeśli jest taka opcja). Sprawdź, czy proces jest kontynuowany.W trakcie procesu, spróbuj ""zatrzymać/zabić"" proces (jeśli jest taka opcja). Sprawdź, czy proces przeliczania zostaje zatrzymany i czy dane są resetowane.Test przypadku użycia: Obsługa błędów podczas przeliczaniaCel: Sprawdzenie, jak aplikacja reaguje na błędy podczas przeliczania (np. brak odpowiedzi z serwera).Kroki:(Wymaga interwencji technicznej lub mockowania API) Zasymuluj błąd podczas wywołania OfferProvider.recalculate lub OfferProvider.checkRecalculation.Sprawdź, czy aplikacja poprawnie obsługuje błąd i czy nie wchodzi w niekończącą się pętlę.Zweryfikuj, czy użytkownik jest informowany o błędzie w czytelny sposób.3. Integracja z Innymi Modułami:Test przypadku użycia: Filtry Rezerwacji (ReservationFilters.vue)Cel: Sprawdzenie, czy filtry rezerwacji nadal poprawnie ładują dane o kanałach i typach pokoi.Kroki:Przejdź do widoku filtrów rezerwacji.Sprawdź, czy filtry (np. lista kanałów, lista typów pokoi) są poprawnie wypełnione danymi.Zastosuj różne filtry i zweryfikuj, czy wyniki są poprawne.Test przypadku użycia: Wydruk Rezerwacji (ReservationPrintoutProvider.vue)Cel: Sprawdzenie, czy wydruk rezerwacji nadal poprawnie ładuje dane o kanałach.Kroki:Otwórz funkcjonalność wydruku rezerwacji (jeśli istnieje).Zweryfikuj, czy dane związane z kanałami są poprawnie wyświetlane na wydruku.Wygeneruj wydruk i sprawdź jego poprawność.Ogólne uwagi do testów:Konsola Deweloperska: Monitoruj konsolę deweloperską pod kątem błędów JavaScript.Zapytania Sieciowe: Używaj narzędzi deweloperskich przeglądarki do monitorowania zapytań sieciowych, aby upewnić się, że dane są pobierane prawidłowo z backendu po migracji.Stan Aplikacji: W narzędziach deweloperskich Vue/Pinia (jeśli są dostępne) sprawdź, czy stan aplikacji (w Pinia store) jest poprawnie aktualizowany.Testy regresyjne: Oprócz powyższych, należy przeprowadzić ogólne testy regresyjne na obszarach, które korzystają z Vuex, aby upewnić się, że migracja nie wprowadziła niezamierzonych skutków ubocznych.Te testy powinny pomóc w weryfikacji, czy wszystkie zmiany związane z migracją do Pinia zostały poprawnie zaimplementowane i nie wpłynęły negatywnie na funkcjonalność aplikacji."

MinStayRequirement i MaxStayRequirement.Przyszłościowo/ alternatywnie włączyć MinLOS i MaxLOS jako warunki walidacyjne, które decydują, czy system w ogóle powinien przejść do naliczania podatku.

This migration requires contacting each client due to the need for different configuration values. The goal is to ensure a seamless transition by implementing a temporary variable to handle both authentication methods during the migration period.ContextCallPay is transitioning its authentication method from Basic Auth to a token-based system. The sunset date for Basic Auth is October 1st, 2025, after which only token-based authentication will be supported. The migration involves changing API endpoints from /v1 to /v2 and requires new configuration values (OrgId and Salt). The integration must support both authentication methods until all clients are migrated.Acceptance criteriaImplement a temporary variable Version=2 to switch to token-based authentication.Ensure the integration supports both Basic Auth and token-based authentication until migration is complete.Update API endpoints to /v2 for all relevant requests.Remove Basic Auth and add necessary headers (Auth-Token, Org-Id, Timestamp) when Version=2 is set.Generate Auth-Token using OrgId, Salt, and a Unix timestamp.Complete migration of all clients before October 1st, 2025.Remove the temporary variable and discontinue Basic Auth after migration.Other informationAnalysis and further details can be found here: CallPay Migration to v2.Postman resources and official documentation are available for reference.The Jira Epic related to this task is CONN-395.Example code for generating the Auth-Token is provided in the documentation.Support task to obtain Salt and OrdId from all Callpay clients: #570237"

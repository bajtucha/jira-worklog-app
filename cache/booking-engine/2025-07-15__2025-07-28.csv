  Backend (PHP):
  - Reservation.php:727 - w metodzie canBeCorrected() - blokuje korekty rezerwacji gdy płatność jest opóźniona
  - Reservation.php:1056 - w metodzie canRecordPayment() - pozwala na rejestrację płatności gdy jest opóźniona
  - ProxyController.php:65,98 - przekazuje informację do API
  - ReservationPresenter.php:72 - w odpowiedzi API
  Frontend Vue.js:
  - ReservationBookerInformation.vue:69 - sprawdza czy pokazać informację o płatności
  - PaymentSchedule.vue:129,146 - wpływa na obliczenia kwoty do zapłaty i komunikaty błędów
  - ReservationTableToPayData.vue:114,123 - podobnie jak wyżej
  - leftToPay.js:39 - zmienia kolor kwoty na błąd gdy płatność opóźniona
  - paymentMessageGenerator.js:90 - generuje komunikaty o anulowaniu rezerwacji
  Legacy Frontend (AngularJS):
  - Payments.js:35,69,82 - określa ikony błędu, tooltips i kwoty do zapłaty
  - buttons.html:29 - kontroluje widoczność przycisków
  - transaction-details.html:14 - pokazuje komunikaty o anulowaniu
  Właściwość jest używana głównie do:
  1. Kontroli możliwości korekt rezerwacji
  2. Stylowania UI (czerwone kolory, ikony błędu)
  3. Generowania komunikatów o problemach z płatnością
  4. Kontroli widoczności elementów interfejsu"

Przykład: jeżeli hotel ma trzy lokalizacje i w każdej lokalizacji po 10 pokoi to na mapie powinny pojawić się trzy punkty i pod każdym (po kliknięciu) 10 pokoi do przejrzenia w popoverze.Aspekt techniczny:Obecne “view on map” na /locations jest w ramach komponentu fakedoor, należy zamienić trigger (kliknięcie) z fakedoora na implementację mapyKomponent mapy powinien przyjmować w prop array z listą obiektów, które będą wyświetlane (każdy obiekt musi mieć koordynaty - latitude oraz longitude). Lista obiektów znajduje się pod endpointem /related-sites (ustal który provider w kodzie odpowiada za pobranie oraz miejsce skąd najlepiej pobrać te dane np. store), każdy element w ramach response ma [address][coordinates][latitude] oraz [address][coordinates][longitude]. Po kliknięciu w obiekt na mapie zawsze wyświetli się popover ale zawartość popovera powinna być definiowana przez <slot> (slot powinien przekazywać parametr “item” co pozwoli na tworzenie zawartości dopasowanych do konkretnego przypadku w którym komponent mapy jest wykorzystywany) Zadania:komponent z mapą która znajduje się już w aplikacji pod {slug}/pricelist/rooms należy wydzielić jako osobny reużywalny komponent który będzie można wykorzystać w dwóch miejscach: {slug}/pricelist/rooms (występuje obecnie) oraz {slug}/locations (dodatkowe, nowe miejsce występowania).

Niemniej jednak warto sprawdzić.Warto zająć się tym taskiem szybko, dopóki są jakieś ślady w Sentry i w LokimLoki, początek problemu: https://tick.profitroom.net/explore?orgId=1&left={""datasource"":""000000013"",""queries"":[{""refId"":""A"",""datasource"":{""type"":""loki"",""uid"":""000000013""},""editorMode"":""builder"",""expr"":""{container%3D\""be-synchronizer-consumer\""} |%3D ``"",""queryType"":""range""}],""range"":{""from"":""1751877720000"",""to"":""1751877900000""}}W lokim w okolicy końca problemu oraz w Sentry są błędy związane z rozjazdem między eloquentem a danymi zapisanymi przez IBL. Był już chyba task na to, tutaj lista błędów Sentry: https://sentry.profitroom.dev/organizations/profitroom/issues/?end=2025-07-07T09%3A06%3A59&project=63&referrer=sidebar&start=2025-07-07T08%3A42%3A00&utc=trueSą m.in. zalogowane informacje debugujące dla handlera eventu reservation-price-changed (logowanie tutaj: https://gitlab-ee.profitroom.net/microservices/monorepo/blob/a7ff3b070277b9699285a2c652170b22430c3a9d/services/be-synchronizer/app/Services/LegacyBooking/LegacyBookingCorrector.php#L34-34), które potwierdzają, że rekord bk_BookingCorections.CorrectionID = 2219552, utworzony przez eloquenta nie jest widoczny z kolei w IBL, bo https://gitlab-ee.profitroom.net/booking-engine/libraries/ideabooking/blob/master/src/BookingTransactions.class.php#L347-347 tu tablica pobrana z bazy jest nullem (błąd Sentry: https://sentry.profitroom.dev/organizations/profitroom/issues/643903/?end=2025-07-07T09%3A06%3A59&project=63&query=is%3Aunresolved&referrer=issue-stream&start=2025-07-07T08%3A42%3A00&stream_index=2&utc=true)Więc problem bywa trochę odwrotny, że IBL nie widzi zmian z Eloquenta, nie potrafię tego wytłumaczyć. Być może w momencie rozpoczęcia transakcji po stronie IBL “zamrażamy” sobie stan bazy danych z momentu rozpoczęcia transakcji i nie widzimy kolejnych zmian robionych przez inne połączenia - jeśli tak, to hipoteza że to IBL pozostawia gdzieś otwartą transakcję się utrzymuje. Jeśli nie, to możliwe, że eloquent również nie kończy gdzieś transakcji, ale mi się kłóci z tym, że wszystkie zmiany zrobione przez eloquenta pozostają w bazie, a IBLowe nie.Dodatkowe wnioski ze spotkania z Marcinem:Z logów w Loki nie dowiemy się kiedy wystartował nowy pod - sprawdziliśmy, że jeśli stary po 60m zakończył pracę, to nowy pod ma ten sam ID (np. be-synchronizer-consumer-5ddc467fb5-87jmc), w logach nie zostawia żadnej informacji o tym, że kończy pracę ani że zaczyna.na mariadb START TRANSACTION commituje dotychczas rozpoczętą transakcję i zaczyna nową. Dlatego:problem może występować dużo częściej, tylko tego nie dostrzegamy, bo kolejny handler rozpoczynający transakcję jednak commituje wiszącą wcześniej transakcjęproblem widzimy tylko w sytuacji, w której IBL robi ROLLBACK albo kończy pracę i PHP automatycznie wycofuje transakcję z rozłączanego połączeniawytłumaczenie obsługi eventu dla rezki 39971934 może być błędne - równoległe działanie 2 podów nie ma miejsca kiedy pierwszy kończy  pracę po 60m i k8s podnosi drugi. To mogło sie zdarzyć tylko jeśli odbył się deployment nowej wersji albo ktoś ubił i wystartował równocześnie nowego poda, ale wtedy zauważyliśmy, że zmienia się id poda, a w lokim widać, że się nie zmienił.Dodatkowe wnioski ze spotkania z Michałem:Booking::CommitAndProcess() gasi wyjątki i zwraca tylko false jeśli coś poszło nie tak, czego nie analizujemy po stronie be-synchronizera, ale w Booking::Exceptions powinny być wyjątki. Zrobiliśmy zmiany w IBL i be-synchronizerze, żeby takie wyjątki logować (patrz MR załączone do taska), bo na ten moment jest to głowna podejrzana metoda, która może zostawiać otwarte transakcje. Poniewaz nie ma wyjątku, be-synchronizer może nie pozostawiać śladów (do weryfikacji, pewnie nigdy)IBL jest ustawiony tak, żeby rzucać wyjątki w razie błędów zapytań (PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE = PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION). Jeśli wierzyć AI, PDO::beginTransaction() w w tym trybie powinien rzucić wyjątek jeśli istnieje aktywna transakcja, zatem IBLowe funkcje mogą wywalać się już na samym początku a wyjątek jest gaszony. Dobrze byłoby naprawić to w IBL, ale będzie to trudne i trochę ryzykowne - łatwiej będzie namierzyć takie sytuacje w be-synchronizerze i tam odpowiednio się zabezpieczyć. spróbuje namierzyć pierwszą operację w bazie produkcyjnej, która rozpoczęła transakcję i jej nie zakończyła i odtworzyć sytuację na lokalnym środowisku.event.reservations.reservation-payment-plan-reset z 10:42:17 (messageId: a77ba715-841a-43c6-9907-2d74631bff93  BookingID: 39962434) zapisało dane przez IBL poprawnie w bk_BookingLogs więc problem zaczął się nie wcześniej niż 10:42:17.603Jedyny event.reservations.reservation-confirmed z okresu 10:42:14 - 10:44:55 to 39971622, messageId b8d5601d-8509-45ae-9500-09e2aa87c5b5 (było ich więcej, ale wszystkie legacyUpdated:true, więc nie modyfikowały bazy legacy). Wg bazy versioning w czasie jego przetwarzania, czyli 10:42:23 nie było żadnego zapisu do bazy i rezerwacja do teraz jest w legacy niepotwierdzona. Nawet jeśli to ten event nie spowodował problemu, możemy już zawęzić czas rozpoczęcia problemu do okresu 10:42:17.603 - 10:42:23.370.pomiędzy w/w eventami były inne, ale handlery nie używały IBLa, albo nie były przetwarzane (legacyUpdated:true spoza whitelisty, albo rezerwacje CM), co wskazuje na jeden z dwóch w/w eventów. Raczej będzie to ten późniejszy (reservation-confirmed), z 2 powodów:handler payment-plan-reset wykonuje przez IBLa jedynie AddLog, bez żadnej transakcjiw handlerze reservation-confirmed wykorzystujemy funkcje IBL z transakcjami i pasowałoby, żeby któraś z nich się nie wykonała.POTWIERDZENIE: operacje w handlerze, które były wykonywane w IBL przed transakcją są w bazie (bk_Transactions, bk_BookingPayments), pozostałe operacje, które były już w transakcji w Booking::Confirm() już nie."

Moduł Ofert (offers):Test przypadku użycia: Wyświetlanie listy ofertCel: Sprawdzenie, czy lista ofert jest poprawnie ładowana i wyświetlana.Kroki:Przejdź do sekcji, gdzie wyświetlane są oferty (np. lista ofert, panel administracyjny ofert).Sprawdź, czy wszystkie oferty są widoczne i poprawnie załadowane.Zweryfikuj, czy dane ofert (nazwa, cena, status itp.) są prawidłowe.Test przypadku użycia: Wyszukiwanie oferty po IDCel: Sprawdzenie, czy funkcja findOfferById działa poprawnie.Kroki:Zidentyfikuj istniejącą ofertę i jej ID.W aplikacji, spróbuj wyszukać lub wyświetlić szczegóły tej oferty, używając jej ID (jeśli istnieje taka funkcjonalność w UI).Zweryfikuj, czy odpowiednie dane oferty są wyświetlane.Spróbuj wyszukać ofertę, która nie istnieje i sprawdź, czy aplikacja poprawnie obsługuje ten scenariusz (np. wyświetla komunikat ""nie znaleziono"").2. Moduł Przeliczania Cen (priceRecalculation):Test przypadku użycia: Inicjowanie przeliczania ceny dla pojedynczej ofertyCel: Sprawdzenie, czy przeliczanie ceny dla pojedynczej oferty jest inicjowane i śledzone.Kroki:Przejdź do widoku oferty, która może być przeliczana (jeśli istnieje taka funkcjonalność UI, np. przycisk ""Przelicz cenę"").Zainicjuj przeliczanie ceny.Obserwuj interfejs użytkownika pod kątem komunikatów o ""recalculation requested"".Po pewnym czasie, sprawdź, czy status przeliczania ceny dla tej oferty został zaktualizowany (np. czy cena jest oznaczona jako przeliczona).Test przypadku użycia: Przeliczanie wielu ofertCel: Sprawdzenie, czy przeliczanie cen dla wielu ofert działa poprawnie.Kroki:Zainicjuj przeliczanie cen dla wielu ofert jednocześnie (jeśli istnieje taka funkcjonalność UI, np. ""przelicz wszystkie ceny"").Monitoruj postęp przeliczania.Zweryfikuj, czy wszystkie wybrane oferty zostały poprawnie przeliczone.Test przypadku użycia: Restartowanie i Zatrzymywanie procesu przeliczaniaCel: Sprawdzenie, czy funkcje restart i kill działają zgodnie z oczekiwaniami.Kroki:Zainicjuj przeliczanie cen.W trakcie procesu, spróbuj ""zrestartować"" (jeśli jest taka opcja). Sprawdź, czy proces jest kontynuowany.W trakcie procesu, spróbuj ""zatrzymać/zabić"" proces (jeśli jest taka opcja). Sprawdź, czy proces przeliczania zostaje zatrzymany i czy dane są resetowane.Test przypadku użycia: Obsługa błędów podczas przeliczaniaCel: Sprawdzenie, jak aplikacja reaguje na błędy podczas przeliczania (np. brak odpowiedzi z serwera).Kroki:(Wymaga interwencji technicznej lub mockowania API) Zasymuluj błąd podczas wywołania OfferProvider.recalculate lub OfferProvider.checkRecalculation.Sprawdź, czy aplikacja poprawnie obsługuje błąd i czy nie wchodzi w niekończącą się pętlę.Zweryfikuj, czy użytkownik jest informowany o błędzie w czytelny sposób.3. Integracja z Innymi Modułami:Test przypadku użycia: Filtry Rezerwacji (ReservationFilters.vue)Cel: Sprawdzenie, czy filtry rezerwacji nadal poprawnie ładują dane o kanałach i typach pokoi.Kroki:Przejdź do widoku filtrów rezerwacji.Sprawdź, czy filtry (np. lista kanałów, lista typów pokoi) są poprawnie wypełnione danymi.Zastosuj różne filtry i zweryfikuj, czy wyniki są poprawne.Test przypadku użycia: Wydruk Rezerwacji (ReservationPrintoutProvider.vue)Cel: Sprawdzenie, czy wydruk rezerwacji nadal poprawnie ładuje dane o kanałach.Kroki:Otwórz funkcjonalność wydruku rezerwacji (jeśli istnieje).Zweryfikuj, czy dane związane z kanałami są poprawnie wyświetlane na wydruku.Wygeneruj wydruk i sprawdź jego poprawność.Ogólne uwagi do testów:Konsola Deweloperska: Monitoruj konsolę deweloperską pod kątem błędów JavaScript.Zapytania Sieciowe: Używaj narzędzi deweloperskich przeglądarki do monitorowania zapytań sieciowych, aby upewnić się, że dane są pobierane prawidłowo z backendu po migracji.Stan Aplikacji: W narzędziach deweloperskich Vue/Pinia (jeśli są dostępne) sprawdź, czy stan aplikacji (w Pinia store) jest poprawnie aktualizowany.Testy regresyjne: Oprócz powyższych, należy przeprowadzić ogólne testy regresyjne na obszarach, które korzystają z Vuex, aby upewnić się, że migracja nie wprowadziła niezamierzonych skutków ubocznych.Te testy powinny pomóc w weryfikacji, czy wszystkie zmiany związane z migracją do Pinia zostały poprawnie zaimplementowane i nie wpłynęły negatywnie na funkcjonalność aplikacji."

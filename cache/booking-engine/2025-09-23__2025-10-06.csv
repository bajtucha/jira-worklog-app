Czy może powinniśmy dodać komunikat przy “zamianie” dziecka na dorosłego ze taka akcja zaszła i żeby zapoznać się z politykami dotyczącymi dzieci w danym hotelu?   W takich przypadkach uznajemy, że dziecko będzie wycenione jak osoba dorosła, na obiektach w których wiek dziecka wykracza poza górną granicę przedziału wiekowego dzieci.

Parametr: EndChargeDayOkreśla, do której doby pobytu naliczany jest podatek lub opłata.Przykłady użycia dla EndChargeDay = 3:Pobyt 1 doba → podatek naliczanyPobyt 2 doby → podatek naliczany za obie dobyPobyt 3 doby → podatek naliczany za wszystkie 3 dobyPobyt 4 doby lub więcej → podatek naliczany tylko za pierwsze 3 doby; brak podatku od 4 doby wzwyż Jednoczesne użycie: StartChargeDay + EndChargeDayPozwala określić konkretny przedział, w którym podatek/opłata ma być naliczana.Przykład: StartChargeDay = 2, EndChargeDay = 7:Podatek naliczany tylko za dni: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7Brak podatku za 1 dobę oraz doby 8+ (jeśli występują)Propozycja zmiany nazewnictwaObecne nazwy MinLOS i MaxLOS są potencjalnie mylące, ponieważ sugerują ograniczenie liczby opodatkowanych nocy, podczas gdy w rzeczywistości służą do filtrowania całych rezerwacji na etapie kwalifikacji.Rekomendacja:Rozważyć zmianę nazw na bardziej jednoznaczne, np. MinStayRequirement i MaxStayRequirement.Przyszłościowo/ alternatywnie włączyć MinLOS i MaxLOS jako warunki walidacyjne, które decydują, czy system w ogóle powinien przejść do naliczania podatku. Przykład: jeżeli rezerwacja spełnia MinLOS = 3, to dopiero wtedy stosowane są reguły StartChargeDay i EndChargeDay.

● Weryfikacja działania podatku bez ograniczeń czasowych    Kroki testowe:
  Skonfiguruj podatek typu ""Per Night"" z kwotą 10.00 bez parametrów ograniczeń => podatek zapisany poprawnie
  Utwórz rezerwację na 3 doby => podatek naliczony za wszystkie 3 doby (30.00 zł)  Weryfikacja parametru StartChargeDay    Kroki testowe:
  Skonfiguruj podatek z StartChargeDay=2, typu ""Per Night"", kwota 10.00 => podatek zapisany z ograniczeniem
  Utwórz rezerwację na 3 doby => podatek naliczony od dnia 2 (20.00 zł za 2 doby)
  Utwórz rezerwację na 2 doby ze StartChargeDay=5 => podatek wynosi 0.00 zł (StartChargeDay przekracza długość pobytu)  Weryfikacja parametru EndChargeDay    Kroki testowe:
  Skonfiguruj podatek z EndChargeDay=2, typu ""Per Night"", kwota 10.00 => podatek zapisany z ograniczeniem
  Utwórz rezerwację na 3 doby => podatek naliczony do dnia 2 (20.00 zł za 2 doby)
  Utwórz rezerwację na 3 doby z EndChargeDay=5 => podatek naliczony za wszystkie 3 doby (30.00 zł, EndChargeDay przekracza długość pobytu)  Weryfikacja kombinacji StartChargeDay i EndChargeDay    Kroki testowe:
  Skonfiguruj podatek z StartChargeDay=2 i EndChargeDay=3, typu ""Per Night"", kwota 10.00 => podatek zapisany z oboma ograniczeniami
  Utwórz rezerwację na 5 dób => podatek naliczony tylko za dni 2-3 (20.00 zł za 2 doby)
  Utwórz rezerwację na 5 dób z StartChargeDay=4 i EndChargeDay=2 => podatek wynosi 0.00 zł (nieprawidłowy zakres)  Weryfikacja ograniczeń dla podatku Per Person Per Night    Kroki testowe:
  Skonfiguruj podatek z StartChargeDay=2, EndChargeDay=4, typu ""Per Person Per Night"", kwota 8.00 => podatek zapisany
  Utwórz rezerwację na 6 dób dla 2 osób => podatek naliczony 48.00 zł (8.00 × 2 osoby × 3 doby)  Weryfikacja walidacji parametrów ograniczeń    Kroki testowe:
  Zapisz podatek z pustym polem Restrictions => podatek zapisany, działa bez ograniczeń
  Zapisz podatek z konfiguracją {""startChargeDay"": null, ""endChargeDay"": 3} => podatek zapisany, tylko endChargeDay aktywneModyfikacja rezerwacji z poziomu gościa, z zachowaniem wprowadzonych parametrów   Po modyfikacji rezerwacji parametry powinny zostać w niej zachowane i wartość podatków powinna wyliczyć się prawidłowo."

Sztywna prezentacja wynikówSystem pokazuje wszystkie znalezione oferty lub wcaleBrak inteligentnej obsługi sytuacji, gdy filtrowanie zwraca pusty wynikNie ma mechanizmu sugerowania alternatywWpływ na użytkownikaFrustracja - gość musi przeglądać wszystkie oferty zamiast od razu zobaczyć te, które go interesująWydłużony proces decyzyjny - brak możliwości szybkiego zawężenia wyboruUtracone konwersje - goście mogą zrezygnować widząc zbyt wiele nieodpowiednich opcjiWymagane rozwiązanie1.

Dynamiczne filtrowanie istniejących wynikówPo prezentacji ofert możliwość filtrowania: ""Z tych ofert pokaż tylko te z kolacją""Filtrowanie po typie pokoju: ""Chcę zobaczyć tylko apartamenty""Sortowanie według różnych kryteriów (cena, popularność, oceny)3.

Do rozkminy pozostaje co z pojedynczymi taskami supportowymi/improvbementami/tumaczeniami , czy wystarczy że wylądują na DEV. boardzie?Automatyzacja releasy - króetki opis, alerty + dokumentacjaINFO OK – da się to zrobić bez zewnętrznych wtyczek, korzystając tylko z Jira Automation i Confluence Automation (z API).
Poniżej masz koncepcję krok po kroku:1. Generowanie release tagu w JiraTrigger: ""Issue transitioned → Completed""Action: Edit issue → ustaw wartość w customowym polu ReleaseTagMożesz użyć smart values, np.:{{now.format(""yyyy-MM-dd"")}}-{{issue.project.key}}-{{issue.components.name.join(""-"")}}
(jeżeli component nie jest ustawiony, zostanie pominięty).Dzięki temu w każdym ukończonym zadaniu masz od razu release marker.2. Logowanie releasu w ConfluenceNie ma natywnej akcji „utwórz stronę w Confluence” w Jira Automation, ale możesz to zrobić przez web request do Confluence REST API:Action: Send web requestURL: https://your-domain.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/content/Method: POSTHeaders:Authorization: Basic <API_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json
Body (JSON), np.:{
  ""type"": ""page"",
  ""title"": ""{{now.format(""yyyy-MM-dd"")}} Release Notes"",
  ""ancestors"": [{""id"": 123456789}],
  ""space"": {""key"": ""PROJ""},
  ""body"": {
    ""storage"": {
      ""value"": ""<p>Task: {{issue.key}} - {{issue.summary}}</p>
                <p>Release tag: {{issue.ReleaseTag}}</p>
                <p>Scope: {{issue.description}}</p>"",
      ""representation"": ""storage""
    }
  }
}
ancestors.id = ID strony nadrzędnej w Confluence, pod którą będą tworzone wpisy.👉 To spowoduje, że przy pierwszym tasku danego dnia utworzy się strona „2025-08-27 Release Notes”.
Dla kolejnych tasków trzeba zamiast POST zrobić GET → UPDATE (czyli najpierw sprawdzić, czy strona istnieje, jeśli tak – dołączyć wpis).3. Grupowanie po dacie (agregacja na stronie)Jira Automation nie potrafi samo sprawdzić, czy dana strona już istnieje.
Dwa rozwiązania:Proste: zawsze tworzysz osobną stronę per task → mniej eleganckie, ale działa out-of-the-box.Lepsze:Najpierw robisz Send web request GET na Confluence API:/wiki/rest/api/content?spaceKey=PROJ&title={{now.format(""yyyy-MM-dd"")}} Release Notes
Jeżeli znajdzie stronę → używasz PUT żeby zaktualizować istniejącą i dopisać nowy task (append do body).Jeżeli nie → tworzysz nową (POST).Tak można zbierać listę tasków na stronie dziennej.4. Struktura strony Release NotesKażda strona dzienna może mieć strukturę:# Release Notes - 2025-08-27
## Tasks
- PROJ-123: Implement feature A (component: API)
- PROJ-124: Fix bug B (component: UI)
## Scope (Summary)
Krótki opis: …
Dzięki temu masz listę tasków + scope, które wchodzą w release.5. AutoryzacjaPotrzebujesz API Tokena Atlassian (wygenerowanego z konta).W Jira Automation web request możesz użyć nagłówka Authorization: Basic, gdzie base64(email:api_token).✅ Podsumowanie:ReleaseTag zapisujesz w polu przez Jira Automation (prosto).Release Notes zapisujesz w Confluence przez web requesty w Automation (REST API).Grupowanie per dzień wymaga logiki: GET → jeśli istnieje update, jeśli nie utwórz.Chcesz, żebym przygotował gotowy szablon reguły Automation w Jira (trigger + condition + web request body do Confluence) do wklejenia w twoją instancję?"

Czy może powinniśmy dodać komunikat przy “zamianie” dziecka na dorosłego ze taka akcja zaszła i żeby zapoznać się z politykami dotyczącymi dzieci w danym hotelu?   W takich przypadkach uznajemy, że dziecko będzie wycenione jak osoba dorosła, na obiektach w których wiek dziecka wykracza poza górną granicę przedziału wiekowego dzieci.

  Utwórz rezerwację na 3 doby => podatek naliczony za wszystkie 3 doby (30.00 zł)  Weryfikacja parametru StartChargeDay    Kroki testowe:
  Skonfiguruj podatek z StartChargeDay=2, typu ""Per Night"", kwota 10.00 => podatek zapisany z ograniczeniem
  Utwórz rezerwację na 3 doby => podatek naliczony od dnia 2 (20.00 zł za 2 doby)
  Utwórz rezerwację na 2 doby ze StartChargeDay=5 => podatek wynosi 0.00 zł (StartChargeDay przekracza długość pobytu)  Weryfikacja parametru EndChargeDay    Kroki testowe:
  Skonfiguruj podatek z EndChargeDay=2, typu ""Per Night"", kwota 10.00 => podatek zapisany z ograniczeniem
  Utwórz rezerwację na 3 doby => podatek naliczony do dnia 2 (20.00 zł za 2 doby)
  Utwórz rezerwację na 3 doby z EndChargeDay=5 => podatek naliczony za wszystkie 3 doby (30.00 zł, EndChargeDay przekracza długość pobytu)  Weryfikacja kombinacji StartChargeDay i EndChargeDay    Kroki testowe:
  Skonfiguruj podatek z StartChargeDay=2 i EndChargeDay=3, typu ""Per Night"", kwota 10.00 => podatek zapisany z oboma ograniczeniami
  Utwórz rezerwację na 5 dób => podatek naliczony tylko za dni 2-3 (20.00 zł za 2 doby)
  Utwórz rezerwację na 5 dób z StartChargeDay=4 i EndChargeDay=2 => podatek wynosi 0.00 zł (nieprawidłowy zakres)  Weryfikacja ograniczeń dla podatku Per Person Per Night    Kroki testowe:
  Skonfiguruj podatek z StartChargeDay=2, EndChargeDay=4, typu ""Per Person Per Night"", kwota 8.00 => podatek zapisany
  Utwórz rezerwację na 6 dób dla 2 osób => podatek naliczony 48.00 zł (8.00 × 2 osoby × 3 doby)  Weryfikacja walidacji parametrów ograniczeń    Kroki testowe:
  Zapisz podatek z pustym polem Restrictions => podatek zapisany, działa bez ograniczeń
  Zapisz podatek z konfiguracją {""startChargeDay"": null, ""endChargeDay"": 3} => podatek zapisany, tylko endChargeDay aktywneModyfikacja rezerwacji z poziomu gościa, z zachowaniem wprowadzonych parametrów   Po modyfikacji rezerwacji parametry powinny zostać w niej zachowane i wartość podatków powinna wyliczyć się prawidłowo."

Czy może powinniśmy dodać komunikat przy “zamianie” dziecka na dorosłego ze taka akcja zaszła i żeby zapoznać się z politykami dotyczącymi dzieci w danym hotelu?   W takich przypadkach uznajemy, że dziecko będzie wycenione jak osoba dorosła, na obiektach w których wiek dziecka wykracza poza górną granicę przedziału wiekowego dzieci.

W BE7 na liście ofert wywołujemy wariant obrazka 400x0:https://res.profitroom.pl/borowydworbiznesspafun/images/offers/thumbs/400x0/UM6fWULUetSyRkfH.pngTo z kolei sprawia, że dostajemy obrazek o szerokości 400px i odpowiednio przeskalowaną wysokość oryginalną żeby zachowane zostały proporcje 40:13.  Kolejnym problemem jest to, że takiej miniaturki nie da się ręcznie wykadrować w Suite:Jak widać obszar zaznaczenia ma 0px wysokości i nie da się go rozszerzyć. Rozwiązaniem jest używanie poprawnego wariantu obrazka w BE7, dostosowanego do miejsca, w którym go wyświetlamy. Musielibyśmy prosić o konkretną wysokość i szerokość obrazka.

Do rozkminy pozostaje co z pojedynczymi taskami supportowymi/improvbementami/tumaczeniami , czy wystarczy że wylądują na DEV. boardzie?Automatyzacja releasy - króetki opis, alerty + dokumentacjaINFO OK – da się to zrobić bez zewnętrznych wtyczek, korzystając tylko z Jira Automation i Confluence Automation (z API).
Poniżej masz koncepcję krok po kroku:1. Generowanie release tagu w JiraTrigger: ""Issue transitioned → Completed""Action: Edit issue → ustaw wartość w customowym polu ReleaseTagMożesz użyć smart values, np.:{{now.format(""yyyy-MM-dd"")}}-{{issue.project.key}}-{{issue.components.name.join(""-"")}}
(jeżeli component nie jest ustawiony, zostanie pominięty).Dzięki temu w każdym ukończonym zadaniu masz od razu release marker.2. Logowanie releasu w ConfluenceNie ma natywnej akcji „utwórz stronę w Confluence” w Jira Automation, ale możesz to zrobić przez web request do Confluence REST API:Action: Send web requestURL: https://your-domain.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/content/Method: POSTHeaders:Authorization: Basic <API_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json
Body (JSON), np.:{
  ""type"": ""page"",
  ""title"": ""{{now.format(""yyyy-MM-dd"")}} Release Notes"",
  ""ancestors"": [{""id"": 123456789}],
  ""space"": {""key"": ""PROJ""},
  ""body"": {
    ""storage"": {
      ""value"": ""<p>Task: {{issue.key}} - {{issue.summary}}</p>
                <p>Release tag: {{issue.ReleaseTag}}</p>
                <p>Scope: {{issue.description}}</p>"",
      ""representation"": ""storage""
    }
  }
}
ancestors.id = ID strony nadrzędnej w Confluence, pod którą będą tworzone wpisy.👉 To spowoduje, że przy pierwszym tasku danego dnia utworzy się strona „2025-08-27 Release Notes”.
Dla kolejnych tasków trzeba zamiast POST zrobić GET → UPDATE (czyli najpierw sprawdzić, czy strona istnieje, jeśli tak – dołączyć wpis).3. Grupowanie po dacie (agregacja na stronie)Jira Automation nie potrafi samo sprawdzić, czy dana strona już istnieje.
Dwa rozwiązania:Proste: zawsze tworzysz osobną stronę per task → mniej eleganckie, ale działa out-of-the-box.Lepsze:Najpierw robisz Send web request GET na Confluence API:/wiki/rest/api/content?spaceKey=PROJ&title={{now.format(""yyyy-MM-dd"")}} Release Notes
Jeżeli znajdzie stronę → używasz PUT żeby zaktualizować istniejącą i dopisać nowy task (append do body).Jeżeli nie → tworzysz nową (POST).Tak można zbierać listę tasków na stronie dziennej.4. Struktura strony Release NotesKażda strona dzienna może mieć strukturę:# Release Notes - 2025-08-27
## Tasks
- PROJ-123: Implement feature A (component: API)
- PROJ-124: Fix bug B (component: UI)
## Scope (Summary)
Krótki opis: …
Dzięki temu masz listę tasków + scope, które wchodzą w release.5. AutoryzacjaPotrzebujesz API Tokena Atlassian (wygenerowanego z konta).W Jira Automation web request możesz użyć nagłówka Authorization: Basic, gdzie base64(email:api_token).✅ Podsumowanie:ReleaseTag zapisujesz w polu przez Jira Automation (prosto).Release Notes zapisujesz w Confluence przez web requesty w Automation (REST API).Grupowanie per dzień wymaga logiki: GET → jeśli istnieje update, jeśli nie utwórz.Chcesz, żebym przygotował gotowy szablon reguły Automation w Jira (trigger + condition + web request body do Confluence) do wklejenia w twoją instancję?"

Do rozkminy pozostaje co z pojedynczymi taskami supportowymi/improvbementami/tumaczeniami , czy wystarczy że wylądują na DEV. boardzie?Automatyzacja releasy - króetki opis, alerty + dokumentacjaINFO OK – da się to zrobić bez zewnętrznych wtyczek, korzystając tylko z Jira Automation i Confluence Automation (z API).
Poniżej masz koncepcję krok po kroku:1. Generowanie release tagu w JiraTrigger: ""Issue transitioned → Completed""Action: Edit issue → ustaw wartość w customowym polu ReleaseTagMożesz użyć smart values, np.:{{now.format(""yyyy-MM-dd"")}}-{{issue.project.key}}-{{issue.components.name.join(""-"")}}
(jeżeli component nie jest ustawiony, zostanie pominięty).Dzięki temu w każdym ukończonym zadaniu masz od razu release marker.2. Logowanie releasu w ConfluenceNie ma natywnej akcji „utwórz stronę w Confluence” w Jira Automation, ale możesz to zrobić przez web request do Confluence REST API:Action: Send web requestURL: https://your-domain.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/content/Method: POSTHeaders:Authorization: Basic <API_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json
Body (JSON), np.:{
  ""type"": ""page"",
  ""title"": ""{{now.format(""yyyy-MM-dd"")}} Release Notes"",
  ""ancestors"": [{""id"": 123456789}],
  ""space"": {""key"": ""PROJ""},
  ""body"": {
    ""storage"": {
      ""value"": ""<p>Task: {{issue.key}} - {{issue.summary}}</p>
                <p>Release tag: {{issue.ReleaseTag}}</p>
                <p>Scope: {{issue.description}}</p>"",
      ""representation"": ""storage""
    }
  }
}
ancestors.id = ID strony nadrzędnej w Confluence, pod którą będą tworzone wpisy.👉 To spowoduje, że przy pierwszym tasku danego dnia utworzy się strona „2025-08-27 Release Notes”.
Dla kolejnych tasków trzeba zamiast POST zrobić GET → UPDATE (czyli najpierw sprawdzić, czy strona istnieje, jeśli tak – dołączyć wpis).3. Grupowanie po dacie (agregacja na stronie)Jira Automation nie potrafi samo sprawdzić, czy dana strona już istnieje.
Dwa rozwiązania:Proste: zawsze tworzysz osobną stronę per task → mniej eleganckie, ale działa out-of-the-box.Lepsze:Najpierw robisz Send web request GET na Confluence API:/wiki/rest/api/content?spaceKey=PROJ&title={{now.format(""yyyy-MM-dd"")}} Release Notes
Jeżeli znajdzie stronę → używasz PUT żeby zaktualizować istniejącą i dopisać nowy task (append do body).Jeżeli nie → tworzysz nową (POST).Tak można zbierać listę tasków na stronie dziennej.4. Struktura strony Release NotesKażda strona dzienna może mieć strukturę:# Release Notes - 2025-08-27
## Tasks
- PROJ-123: Implement feature A (component: API)
- PROJ-124: Fix bug B (component: UI)
## Scope (Summary)
Krótki opis: …
Dzięki temu masz listę tasków + scope, które wchodzą w release.5. AutoryzacjaPotrzebujesz API Tokena Atlassian (wygenerowanego z konta).W Jira Automation web request możesz użyć nagłówka Authorization: Basic, gdzie base64(email:api_token).✅ Podsumowanie:ReleaseTag zapisujesz w polu przez Jira Automation (prosto).Release Notes zapisujesz w Confluence przez web requesty w Automation (REST API).Grupowanie per dzień wymaga logiki: GET → jeśli istnieje update, jeśli nie utwórz.Chcesz, żebym przygotował gotowy szablon reguły Automation w Jira (trigger + condition + web request body do Confluence) do wklejenia w twoją instancję?"
